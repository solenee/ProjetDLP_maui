Introduction
The main objective of research in soil science is the understanding of the nature, properties, dynamics and functions of the soil as part of landscapes and ecosystems. A basic requirement for attaining that objective is the availability of reliable information on soil morphology and other characteristics obtained through examination and description of the soil in the field. It is important that soil description be done thoroughly; it serves as the basis for soil classification and site evaluation as well as interpretations on the genesis and environmental functions of the soil. A good soil description and the derived knowledge on the genesis of the soil are also powerful tools to guide, help explain and regulate costly laboratory work. It can also prevent errors in soil sampling. Figure 1 shows the role of soil description as an early step to classification, soil and site assessment, and suitability evaluation.

Guidelines for soil description

Soils are affected by human activities, such as industrial, municipal and agriculture, that often result in soil degradation and loss or reduction in soil functions. In order to prevent soil degradation and to rehabilitate the potentials of degraded soils, reliable soil data are the most important prerequisite for the design of appropriate land-use systems and soil management practices as well as for a better understanding of the environment. With the present internationalization, the use of a common language is of prime importance, also in soil science. The increasing need for internationally accepted rules and systems of soil description and soil classification led to the development of various soil classification concepts, e.g. the FAO­UNESCO Legend for the Soil Map of the World (FAO­UNESCO, 1974, 1988) and Soil Taxonomy (USDA Soil Survey Staff 1975, 1999), and soil maps, e.g. the Soil Map of the World (FAO­ UNESCO, 1970­1981; FAO, 2002), Soil Map of the European Communities (ECSC­EEC­EAEC, 1985), and Soil Atlas of Europe (EC, 2005). These guidelines are based on the internationally accepted Guidelines for Soil Description (FAO, 1990). Some new international developments in soil information systems and soil classification, such as the Field Book for Describing and Sampling Soils (Schoeneberger et al., 2002) and Keys to Soil Taxonomy (USDA Soil Survey Staff, 2003), Updated Global and National Soils and Terrain Digital Databases (ISRIC, 2005) and the second edition of the World Reference Base for Soil Resources (IUSS Working Group WRB, 2006) are taken into consideration. For practical reasons, the contents of the major sources were modified, shortened and rearranged. Specifically, the various chapters of this field guide were based on the following sources: Chapter 2 on general site description ­ Guidelines for Soil Description (FAO, 1990). Chapter 3 on the description of soil forming factors ­ Guidelines for Soil Description (FAO, 1990); updated SOTER (ISRIC, 2005); Field Book for Describing and Sampling Soils (Schoeneberger et al., 2002); and Keys to Soil Taxonomy (USDA Soil Survey Staff, 2003). Chapter 4 on soil description ­ Guidelines for Soil Description (FAO, 1990) and partly the German Mapping Guide 5 (Kartieranleitung 5; Adhoc-AG-Boden, 2005), the material of DVWK (1995), Field Book for Describing and Sampling Soils (Schoeneberger et al., 2002), as well as the personal experiences of the authors. Chapter 5 on horizon designation and soil classification ­ Guidelines for Soil Description (FAO, 1990), Field Book for Describing and Sampling Soils (Schoeneberger et al., 2002), Keys to Soil Taxonomy (USDA Soil Survey Staff, 2003) and the second edition of the World Reference Base for Soil Resources (IUSS Working Group WRB, 2006). To help beginners, some explanatory notes are included as well as keys based on simple tests and observations for the determination of soil characteristics. The guidelines provide a complete procedure for soil description and for collecting field data necessary for classification according to second edition of the

World Reference Base for Soil Resources (WRB) (IUSS Working Group WRB, 2006). Notes for classification purposes are added to each chapter and explain the relevance of the described feature for classification according to the WRB. In order to avoid being excessively lengthy, it is not stated whether the described feature is a required one or is one of two or more options.

Chapter 2

General site information, registration and location
Before any actual soil description should be done, it is necessary to take note of some relevant information related to the registration and identification of the soil to be described, such as profile number, description status, date of description, author, location, elevation, map sheet number, and grid reference. This information is necessary for easy referencing and retrieval of the soil description from data storage systems. PROFILE NUMBER The profile number or profile identification code should be constructed in such a way that it meets local needs and also allows easy and simple retrieval of profile descriptions from computerized data storage systems. The profile identification code should be constructed from a combination of a location letter code and a profile number code. The letter code should consist of a practical selection of codes referring to a country, preferably the internationally accepted International Organization for Standardization (ISO) code, a topographic map reference or any other defined area or town. Example: DE/ST/HAL -0381 = Halle in SaxonyAnhalt in Germany, profile 381. SOIL PROFILE DESCRIPTION STATUS The status of the soil profile description refers to the quality of the soil description and the analytical data. The status is allocated after completion of the analyses and is indicative of the reliability of soil profile information entered into a database. Table 1 lists the possible descriptions. DATE OF DESCRIPTION It is important to always indicate the date of description in order to inform future users of the soil data as to how old the data are. The date of description is given as: yymmdd (six digits). For example, 8 January 2006 would be coded 060108. AUTHORS The persons who perform the description need to be acknowledged properly in future uses of the soil data. In addition, they hold responsibility for the quality of the data. The names or initials of the authors are given.

TABLE 1

Soil profile description status
Status 1 Reference profile description No essential elements or details are missing from the description, sampling or analysis. The accuracy and reliability of the description and analytical results permit the full characterization of all soil horizons to a depth of 125 cm, or more if required for classification, or down to a C or R horizon or layer, which may be shallower. If soil description is done without sampling. Routine profile description No essential elements are missing from the description, sampling or analysis. The number of samples collected is sufficient to characterize all major soil horizons, but may not allow precise definition of all subhorizons, especially in the deeper soil. The profile depth is 80 cm or more, or down to a C or R horizon or layer, which may be shallower. Additional augering and sampling may be required for lower level classification. If soil description is done without sampling. Incomplete description Certain relevant elements are missing from the description, an insufficient number of samples was collected, or the reliability of the analytical data does not permit a complete characterization of the soil. However, the description is useful for specific purposes and provides a satisfactory indication of the nature of the soil at high levels of soil taxonomic classification. If soil description is done without sampling. Soil augering description Soil augerings do no permit a comprehensive soil profile description. Augerings are made for routine soil observation and identification in soil mapping, and for that purpose normally provide a satisfactory indication of the soil characteristics. Soil samples may be collected from augerings. If soil description is done without sampling. Other descriptions Essential elements are missing from the description, preventing a satisfactory soil characterization and classification.

Note: Descriptions from soil augerings or from other observations made for routine soil mapping are either kept on ordinary field data sheets or included in the database, with an appropriate indication of status.

LOCATION A description of the soil location should be given. It should be as precise as possible in terms of the distance (in metres or kilometres) and direction to the site from permanent features that are recognizable in the field and on the topographic map. Distances along roads or traverses relate to a marked reference point (0.0 km). The description of the location should be such that readers who are unfamiliar with the area are able to locate the approximate position of the site. The administrative units, such as region, province, district, country or locality, are given in the profile number section (above). Example: Agricultural research station Bad Lauchstädt, Sachsen-Anhalt. ELEVATION The elevation of the site relative to sea level should be obtained as accurately as possible, preferably from detailed contour or topographic maps. Where such information is not available, the best possible estimate is made from general maps or by altimeter readings. At present, determination of elevation by the Global Positioning System (GPS) unit is inaccurate and unacceptable. Elevation is given in metres (1 foot = 0.3048 m).

MAP SHEET NUMBER AND GRID REFERENCE (COORDINATES) The number of the topographic map sheet, preferably at 1:25 000 or 1:50 000 scale, on which the soil observation occurs is given. Example: TK50 L4536 Halle (Saale) = Topographic map 1:50 000 Number L4536 of Halle. The grid reference number, Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) or the established local system, can be read directly from the topographic map. The latitude and longitude of the site are given as accurately as possible (in degrees, minutes, seconds and decimal seconds); they can be derived directly from topographic maps or a GPS unit. Example: H: 56.95.250 or latitude: 51° 23´ 30.84´´ N; R: 44.91.600 or longitude: 11° 52´ 40.16´´ E. Some countries use their own zero longitude, e.g. Italian topographic maps show the Monte Mario meridian at Rome as zero. For international use, these should be converted to the zero meridian of the Greenwich system.

Chapter 3

Soil formation factors
This chapter provides the guidelines for the description of factors that define the kind and intensity of soil formation processes. These factors are also part of the important site qualities. The information may be derived from a combination of field measurements, climate records, field observations and evaluation of climate, topographical, geological and geomorphological maps and documents. For land use and vegetation, the present conditions are reported. ATMOSPHERIC CLIMATE AND WEATHER CONDITIONS The climate conditions of a site are important site properties that influence plant growth and soil formation. As minimum climate data, the monthly mean temperature (in degrees Celsius) and the monthly mean precipitation (in millimetres) can be taken from the nearest meteorological station. Where available, the length of the growing period (in days) should be specified. The length of the growing period is defined as the period with humid conditions (excess of precipitation over potential evapotranspiration) during the time with temperature  5 °C (FAO, 1978). The present as well as the weather conditions days or weeks before the description influence soil moisture and structure, hence these should be noted. In addition, the prevailing general weather conditions and the air temperature TABLE 2 at the time of observation as well Codes for weather conditions as that of the near past should be Present weather conditions (Schoeneberger et al., 2002) SU sunny/clear documented (Table 2).

SOIL CLIMATE Where applicable, the soil climate classification should be indicated. The soil moisture and temperature regimes according to Keys to Soil Taxonomy (USDA Soil Survey Staff, 2003) may be mentioned (Table 3; explanations in Annexes 1 and 2). Where such information is not available or cannot be derived from representative climate data with confidence, it is preferable to

LANDFORM AND TOPOGRAPHY (RELIEF) Landform refers to any physical feature on the earth's surface that has been formed by natural processes and has a distinct shape. Topography refers to the configuration of the land surface described in four categories: the major landform, which refers to the morphology of the whole landscape; the position of the site within the landscape; the slope form; the slope angle. Major landform Landforms are described foremost by their morphology and not by their genetic origin or processes responsible for their shape. The dominant slope is the most important differentiating criterion, followed by the relief intensity (Table 4). The relief intensity is the median difference between the highest and lowest point within the terrain per specified distance. The specified distance can be variable. The relief intensity is normally given in metres per kilometre. With complex landforms, the protruding landform should be at least 25 m high (if not it is to be considered mesorelief) except for terraced land, where the main terraces should have elevation differences of at least 10 m. In areas, the major terraces may be very close to each other ­ particularly towards the lower part of the plain. Finally, the older levels may become buried by down wash. For complex landforms, subdivisions can be used (Table 5). These subdivisions are mainly applicable to level landforms, to some extent to sloping landforms and, in the case of mountains, to intermontane plains. Position The relative position of the site within the land should be indicated. The position affects the hydrological conditions of the site (external and internal drainage, e.g.

Slope gradient and orientation The slope gradient refers to the SS SV SC slope of the land immediately surrounding the site. It is measured using a clinometer aimed in the direction of the steepest slope. VS VV VC Where clinometer readings are not possible, field estimates of slope gradient should be matched against calculated gradients from CS CV CC contour maps.

In addition to the attributes of slope in Table 7, both the slope length (particularly above the site) and aspect (orientation) should be recorded. The orientation influences, for example, the precipitation input, the temperature regime, the risk for wind impact and the character of humus formed in higher latitudes.

The orientation that a slope is facing is coded N for north, E for east, S for south and W for west; for example, SSW means south-southwest. LAND USE AND VEGETATION Land use Land use applies to the current use of the land, whether agricultural or nonagricultural, in which the soil is located. Land use has a major influence on the direction and rate of soil formation; its recording enhances the interpretative value of the soil data considerably (Table 8). For arable land use, the dominant crops grown should be mentioned (section on crops [below]), and as much information as possible given on soil management, use of fertilizers, duration of fallow period, rotation systems and yields. Crops Crops are plants that are cultivated for their economic value. Information on crops is important because it gives an idea of the nature of soil disturbance as a result of crop management practices as well as the nutrient and soil management requirements of the crop. Information on crops can be given in a general or detailed way as required. Examples for the most common crops with their recommended codes are given in Table 9. Human influence This item refers to any evidence of human activity that is likely to have affected the landscape or the physical and chemical properties of the soil. Erosion is dealt with separately in Chapter 4. For various environments, it is useful to indicate the degree of disturbance of the natural vegetation. The existing vegetation is described in the section on vegetation (below). Examples of human influences with their recommended codes are given in Table 10. Note for classification purposes Constructed terraces Escalic qualifier. Raised land surfaces plaggic and terric horizons. Ploughing anthraquic and anthric horizons and Aric qualifier.

Vegetation Vegetation is a dominant factor in soil formation as it is the primary source of organic matter and because of its major role in the nutrient cycling and hydrology of a site. There is no uniform acceptance of a system for the description of the natural or semi-natural vegetation. The kind of vegetation can be described using a local, regional or international system. A common example is the vegetation classification according to UNESCO (1973, see updated SOTER; ISRIC, 2005), presented in Table 11 with codes added. In addition, other characteristics of the vegetation, such as height of trees or canopy cover, may be recorded. PARENT MATERIAL The parent material is the material from which the soil has presumably been derived. The parent material should be described as accurately as possible, indicating its origin and nature. There are basically two groups of parent material on which the soil has formed: unconsolidated materials (mostly sediments); and weathering materials overlying the hard rock from which they originate. There are transitional cases, such as partly consolidated materials and weathering materials that have been transported, either by water, called alluvium (fluvial if transported by stream), or by gravity, called colluvium. There are also restored natural soil materials or sediments as well as technogenic materials. The reliability of the geological information and the knowledge of the local lithology will determine whether a general or a specific definition of the parent material can be given.

Chapter 3 ­ Soil formation factors

17

For weathered rock, the code WE is first entered, followed by the rock-type code. The code SA for saprolite is recommended where the in situ weathered material is thoroughly decomposed, clay-rich but still showing rock structure. Alluvial deposits and colluvium derived from a single rock type may be further specified by that rock type. Where one parent material overlies another, both are indicated. The parent material is coded according to updated SOTER (ISRIC, 2005) at the lowest level of hierarchy as possible. As SOTER was developed to work with maps on a scale of 1:1 000 000, it was a requirement to have not too many rock types. In order to be able to work in smaller scales, some additional natural and anthropogenic parent materials are included in Table 12. For identification in the field, a key to the most important rock types is provided below the extended hierarchical SOTER list. Note for classification purposes Remains intact when a specimen of 25­30 mm is submerged in water for 1 hour; roots cannot penetrate except along vertical cracks that have an average horizontal spacing of  10 cm and that occupy < 20 percent (by volume); no significant displacement has taken place continuous rock. Differences in lithology lithological discontinuity. Recent sediments above the soil that is classified at the Reference Soil Group (RSG) level Novic qualifier. Sedimentation through human-induced erosion colluvic material. Coprogenous earth or sedimentary peat, diatomaceous earth, marl or gyttja limnic material. Remnants of birds or bird activity ornithogenic material. greater thickness Organic material consisting of  75 percent of moss fibres of organic material required for Histosols. Ombric qualifier. Moor peat saturated predominantly with rainwater Bog peat saturated predominantly with groundwater or flowing surface water Rheic qualifier. AGE OF THE LAND SURFACE The age of the landscape is important information from which the possible duration of the occurrence of soil formation processes can be derived. Because many soils are formed from preweathered or moved materials, or may have been derived from an assemblage of autochthonous, fluvial and eolian materials, it is often difficult to obtain precise information. However, an estimate will help to interpret soil data and interaction between different soil forming processes. It may also indicate possible climate changes during soil formation. Table 13 provides a provisional coding.

Soil description
This chapter presents the procedure to describe the different morphological and other characteristics of the soil. This is best done using a recently dug pit large enough to allow sufficient examination and description of the different horizons. Old exposures such as road cuts and ditches may be used, but only after scraping off sufficient material to expose the fresh soil. First, the surface characteristics are recorded. Then, the soil description is done horizon by horizon, starting with the uppermost one. The rules of soil description and the coding of attributes are generally based on the guidelines for soil description according to FAO (1990). Additions have a citation. SURFACE CHARACTERISTICS Where present, surface characteristics, such as rock outcrops, coarse rock fragments, human-induced erosion, surface sealing and surface cracks, should be recorded. A number of other surface characteristics, such as the occurrence of salts, bleached sands, litter, worm casts, ant paths, cloddiness, and puddling, may be also be recorded. Rock outcrops Exposures of bedrock may limit the use of modern mechanized agricultural equipment. Rock outcrops should be described in terms of percentage surface cover, together with additional relevant information on the size, spacing and hardness of the individual outcrops. Table 14 lists the recommended classes of percentage of surface cover and of average distance between rock outcrops (single or clusters). Coarse surface fragments Coarse surface fragments, including those partially exposed, should be described in terms of percentage of surface coverage and of size of the fragments. Classes of occurrence of coarse surface fragments are correlated with the ones for rock outcrop, as per Table 15.

Note for classification purposes Pavement (consisting of rock outcrops or surface coarse fragments) that is varnished or includes wind-shaped gravel or stones or is associated with a vesicular layer yermic horizon. Erosion In describing soil erosion, emphasis should be given to accelerated or human-induced erosion. It is not always easy to distinguish between natural and accelerated erosion as they are often closely related. Human-induced erosion is the result of irrational use and poor management, such as inappropriate agricultural practices, overgrazing and removal or overexploitation of the natural vegetation. Main categories Erosion can be classified as water or wind erosion (Table 16), and include off-site effects such as deposition; a third major category is mass movements (landslides and related phenomena). Area affected The total area affected by erosion and deposition is estimated following the classes defined by SOTER (FAO, 1995) as per Table 17. Degree It is difficult to define classes of the degree of erosion that would be equally appropriate for all soils and environments and that would also fit the various types of water and wind erosion. Four classes are recommended (Table 18), which

For example, in the H Active in historical times case of gully and rill erosion, the N Period of activity not known depth and spacing may need to be X Accelerated and natural erosion not distinguished recorded; for sheet erosion, the loss of topsoil; for dunes, the height; and for deposition, the thickness of the layer. Activity The period of activity of accelerated erosion or deposition is described using the recommended classes in Table 19. Note for classification purposes Evidence of aeolian activity: rounded or subangular sand particles showing a matt surface; wind-shaped rock fragments; aeroturbation; wind erosion or sedimentation aridic properties. Surface sealing Surface sealing is used to describe crusts that develop at the soil surface after the topsoil dries out. These crusts may inhibit seed germination, reduce water infiltration and increase runoff. The attributes of surface sealing are the consistence, when dry, and thickness of the crust as per Table 20. Note for classification purposes Surface crust that does not curl entirely upon drying Surface crust Hyperochric qualifier.

Other surface characteristics A number of other surface characteristics, such as the occurrence of salts, bleached sands, litter, worm casts, ant paths, cloddiness and puddling, may be recorded.

HORIZON BOUNDARY Horizon boundaries provide information on the dominant soil-forming processes that have formed the soil. In certain cases, they reflect past anthropogenic impacts on the landscape. Horizon boundaries are described in terms of depth, distinctness and topography. Depth Most soil boundaries are zones of transition rather than sharp lines of division. The depth of the upper and lower boundaries of each horizon is given in centimetres, measured from the surface (including organic and mineral covers) of the soil downwards. Precise notations in centimetres are used where boundaries are abrupt or clear. Rounded-off figures (to the nearest 5 cm) are entered where the boundaries are gradual or diffuse, avoiding the suggestion of spurious levels of accuracy.

Chapter 4 ­ Soil description

However, if boundary depths are TABLE 24 near diagnostic limits, rounded- Classification of horizon boundaries, by distinctness and topography off figures should not be used. In Distinctness Topography this case, the depth is indicated as (cm) a medium value for the transitional A Abrupt 0­2 S Smooth Nearly plane surface zone (if it starts at 16 cm and C Clear 2­5 W Wavy Pockets less deep than wide terminates at 23 cm, the depth G Gradual 5­15 I Irregular Pockets more deep than should be 19.5 cm). wide Most horizons do not have a D Diffuse > 15 B Broken Discontinuous constant depth. The variation or irregularity of the surface of the boundary is described by the topography in terms of smooth, wavy, irregular and broken. If required, ranges in depth should be given in addition to the average depth, for example 28 (25­31) cm to 45 (39­51) cm. Note for classification purposes Many diagnostic horizons and properties are found at a certain depth. Important boundary depths are 10, 20, 25, 40, 50, 100 and 120 cm. Distinctness and topography The distinctness of the boundary refers to the thickness of the zone in which the horizon boundary can be located without being in one of the adjacent horizons (Table 24). The topography of the boundary indicates the smoothness of depth variation of the boundary. Note for classification purposes Cryoturbation cryic horizon, Cryosols and Turbic qualifier. Tonguing of a mollic or umbric horizon into an underlying layer Glossic qualifier. Tonguing of an eluvial albic horizon into an argic horizon albeluvic tonguing and Glossalbic qualifier. Diffuse horizon boundaries Nitisols. PRIMARY CONSTITUENTS This section presents the procedure on the description of soil texture and the nature of the primary rock and mineral fragments, which are subdivided into: (i) the fine earth fraction; and (ii) the coarse fragments fraction. Texture of the fine earth fraction Soil texture refers to the proportion of the various particle-size classes (or soil separates, or fractions) in a given soil volume and is described as soil textural class (Figure 4). The names for the particle-size classes correspond closely with commonly used standard terminology, including that of the system used by the

26

Guidelines for soil description

United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). However, many national systems describing particle-size and textural classes use more or less the same names but different grain fractions of sand, silt and clay, and textural classes. This publication uses the 2000­63­2-m system for particle-size fractions. Soil textural classes The names of the textural classes (which describe combined particle-size classes) of the described soil material are coded as in Figure 4. In addition to the textural class, a field estimate of the percentage of clay is given. This estimate is useful for indicating increases or decreases in clay content within textural classes, and for comparing field estimates with analytical results. The relationship between the basic textural classes and the percentages of clay, silt and sand is indicated in a triangular form in Figure 4. Subdivision of the sand fraction Sands, loamy sands and sandy loams are subdivided according to the proportions of very coarse to coarse, medium, fine and very fine sands in the sand fraction. The proportions are calculated from the particle-size distribution, taking the total of the sand fraction as being 100 percent (Figure 4). Field estimation of textural classes The textural class can be estimated in the field by simple field tests and feeling the constituents of the soil (Table 25). For this, the soil sample must be in a moist to weak wet state. Gravel and other constituents > 2 mm must be removed. The constituents have the following feel: Clay: soils fingers, is cohesive (sticky), is formable, has a high plasticity and has a shiny surface after squeezing between fingers. Silt: soils fingers, is non-sticky, only weakly formable, has a rough and ripped surface after squeezing between fingers and feels very floury (like talcum powder). Sand: cannot be formed, does not soil fingers and feels very grainy. Note for classification purposes Important diagnostic characteristics derived from the textural class are: A texture that is loamy sand or coarser to a depth of  100 cm Arenosol. A texture of loamy fine sand or coarser in a layer  30 cm thick within 100 cm of the soil surface Arenic qualifier. A texture of silt, silt loam, silty clay loam or silty clay in a layer  30 cm thick, within 100 cm of the soil surface Siltic qualifier. A texture of clay in a layer  30 cm thick within 100 cm of the soil surface Clayic qualifier.  30 percent clay throughout a thickness of 25 cm vertic horizon.  30 percent clay throughout a thickness of 15 cm vertic properties.  30 percent clay between the soil surface and a vertic horizon Vertisol.

Artefacts (sections on artefacts and description of artefacts [below]) are useful for identifying colluviation, human occupation, and industrial processes. Large rock and mineral fragments (> 2 mm) and artefacts are described according to abundance, size, shape, state of weathering, and nature of the fragments. The abundance class TABLE 26 limits correspond with the ones Abundance of rock fragments and artefacts, by volume for surface coarse fragments and % mineral nodules, and the 40- N None 0 0­2 percent boundary coincides with V Very few Few 2­5 the requirement for the skeletic F C Common 5­15 phase (Table 26 and Figure 5).

Partial weathering is indicated by discoloration and loss of crystal form in the outer parts of the fragments while the centres remain relatively fresh and the fragments have lost little of their original strength. All but the most resistant minerals are weathered, strongly discoloured and altered throughout the fragments, which tend to disintegrate under only moderate pressure.

For primary mineral fragments, other codes can be used, e.g. as per Table 30. Fragments of individual weatherable minerals (e.g. feldspars and micas) may be smaller than 2 mm in diameter. Nevertheless, where present in appreciable quantities, such fragments should be mentioned separately in the description. For artefacts, see section on artefacts (below).

Degree of decomposition and humification of peat In most organic layers, the determination of the texture class is not possible. More valuable is an estimate of the degree of decomposition and humification of the organic material. Colour and percentage of recognizable plant tissue of dry as well as of wet organic material can be used to estimate the degree of decomposition (Table 31). Note for classification purposes Histosols have more than two-thirds (by volume) recognizable plant tissues Fibric qualifier. Histosols have between two-thirds and one-sixth (by volume) recognizable plant tissues Hemic qualifier. Histosols have less than one-sixth (by volume) recognizable plant tissues Sapric qualifier. Aeromorphic organic layers on forest floors On forest floors, especially under temperate and cool climates, organic matter is commonly accumulated in more or less decomposed organic layers under terrestrial conditions. In acidic and nutrient poor mineral soils, the nutrient stock of the organic layers is of vital interest for the vegetation cover. The three major forms, raw humus, moder and mull, are described as follows: Raw humus (aeromorphic mor): usually thick (5­30 cm) organic matter accumulation that is largely unaltered owing to lack of decomposers. This kind of organic matter layer develops in extremely nutrient-poor and coarsetextured soils under vegetation that produces a litter layer that is difficult to decompose. It is usually a sequence of Oi­Oe­Oa layers over a thin A horizon, easy to separate one layer from another and being very acid with a C/N ratio of > 29.

Chapter 4 ­ Soil description

33

Moder (duff mull): more decomposed than raw humus but characterized by

an organic matter layer on top of the mineral soil with a diffuse boundary between the organic matter layer and A horizon. In the sequence of Oi­Oe­ Oa layers, it is difficult to separate one layer from another. This develops in moderately nutrient-poor conditions, usually under a cool moist climate. It is usually acidic with a C/N ratio of 18­29. Mull: characterized by the periodic absence of organic matter accumulation on the surface owing to the rapid decomposition process and mixing of organic matter and the mineral soil material by bioturbation. It is usually slightly acid to neutral with a C/N ratio of 10­18. SOIL COLOUR (MATRIX) Soil colour reflects the composition as well as the past and present oxidationreduction conditions of the soil. It is generally determined by coatings of very fine particles of humified organic matter (dark), iron oxides (yellow, brown, orange and red), manganese oxides (black) and others, or it may be due to the colour of the parent rock. The colour of the soil matrix l of each horizon should be recorded in the moist condition (or both dry and moist conditions where possible) using the notations for hue, value and chroma as given in the Munsell Soil Color Charts (Munsell, 1975). Hue is the dominant spectral colour (red, yellow, green, blue or violet), value is the lightness or darkness of colour ranging from 1 (dark) to 8 (light), and chroma is the purity or strength of colour ranging from 1 (pale) to 8 (bright). Where there is no dominant soil matrix colour, the horizon is described as mottled and two or more colours are given. In addition to the colour notations, the standard Munsell colour names may be given. For routine descriptions, soil colours should be determined out of direct sunlight and by matching a broken ped with the colour chip of the Munsell Soil Color Charts. For special purposes, such as for soil classification, additional colours from crushed or rubbed material may be required. The occurrence of contrasting colours related to the structural organization of the soil, such as ped surfaces, may be noted. Where possible, soil colour should be determined under uniform conditions. Early morning and late evening readings are not accurate. Moreover, the determination of colour by the same or different individuals has often proved to be inconsistent. Because soil colour is significant with respect to various soil properties, including organic matter contents, coatings and state of oxidation or reduction, and for soil classification, cross-checks are recommended and should be established on a routine basis. Note for classification purposes Intermediate colours should be recorded where desirable for the distinction between two soil horizons and for purposes of classification and interpretation of the soil profile. Intermediate hues (important for qualifiers, such as Chromic

or Rhodic, and for diagnostic horizons, such as cambic) that may be used are: 3.5, 4, 6, 6.5, 8.5 and 9 YR. For example, when 3.5 YR is noted, it means that the intermediate hue is closer to 2.5 YR than 5 YR; 4 YR means closer to 5 YR, and so on. If values and chromas are near diagnostic limits, rounded-off figures should not be used, but accurate recordings should be made by using intermediate values, or by adding a + or a -. Important diagnostic hues, values and chromas are: Abrupt changes in colour not resulting from pedogenesis lithological discontinuity.

MOTTLING Mottles are spots or blotches of different colours or shades of colour interspersed with the dominant colour of the soil. They indicate that the soil has been subject to alternate wetting (reducing) and dry (oxidizing) conditions. Mottling of the soil matrix or groundmass is described in terms of abundance, size, contrast, boundary and colour. In addition, the shape, position or any other feature may be recorded. Note for classification purposes Mottles of oxides in the form of coatings or in platy, polygonal or reticulate patterns are diagnostic for the anthraquic (plough pan), hydragric, ferric, plinthic and petroplinthic horizons and for the gleyic colour pattern. Mottles of oxides in the form of concretions or nodules are diagnostic for the hydragric, ferric, plinthic, petroplinthic and, pisoplinthic horizons and for the stagnic colour pattern. Redox depleted zones in macropores with a value  4 and a chroma  2 are diagnostic for the hydragric horizon. Mottles or coatings of jarosite or schwertmannite are diagnostic for the thionic horizon and the Aceric qualifier. Mottles in the form of yellow concentrations are diagnostic for the thionic horizon. Colour of mottles It is usually sufficient to describe the colour of the mottles in general terms, corresponding to the Munsell Soil Color Charts. Abundance of mottles The abundance of mottles is described in terms of classes indicating the percentage of the exposed surface that the mottles occupy (Table 32). The class limits correspond to those of mineral nodules. When the abundance of mottles does not allow the distinction of a single predominant matrix or groundmass colour, the predominant colours should be determined and entered as soil matrix colours. Size of mottles Table 33 lists the classes used to indicate the approximate diameters

They may vary by as much as 2.5 units of hue or several units in chroma or value. The mottles are conspicuous and mottling is one of the outstanding features of the horizon. Hue, chroma and value alone or in combination are at least several units apart.

SOIL REDOX POTENTIAL AND REDUCING CONDITIONS Determination of redox potential by field method Soil redox potential is an important physico-chemical parameter used to characterize soil aeration status and availability of some nutrients (Table 36). The redox potential is also used in the WRB classification to classify redoximorphic soils. To measure redox potential (DIN/ISO Draft, DVWK, 1995), drive a hole into the soil using a rigid rod (stainless steel, 20­100 cm long, with a diameter that is 2 mm greater than the redox electrodes) to a depth about 1­2 cm less than the desired depth to be measured. Immediately clean the platinum surface of the redox electrode with sandpaper and insert the electrode about 1 cm deeper than the prepared hole. At least two electrodes should be installed for each depth

being measured. After at least 30 minutes, measure the redox potential with a millivoltmeter against a reference electrode (e.g. Ag/AgCl in KCl of the glass electrode of pH measurements, installed in a small hole on the topsoil that has been filled with 1-M KCl solution). For dry topsoil, a salt bridge (plastic tube 2 cm in diameter and with open ends, filled with 0.5 percent (M/M) agar in KCl solution) should be installed in a hole beside and at the depth of the platinum electrodes. In this tube, the reference electrode should be installed. The measured voltage (Em) is related to the voltage of the standard hydrogen electrode by adding the potential of the reference electrode (e.g. +244 millivolt at 10 °C of Ag/AgCl in 1 M KCl, +287 of Calomel electrode). For interpretation, the results should be transformed to rH values using the formula: rH = 2pH + 2Eh/59 (Eh in mV at 25 °C). Note the rH value on the description sheet. Reducing conditions Reductimorphic properties of the soil matrix reflect permanently wet or at least reduced conditions (Table 37). They are expressed by neutral (white to black: Munsell N1 to N) or bluish to greenish colours (Munsell 2.5 Y, 5 Y, 5 G, 5 B). The colour pattern will often change by aeration in minutes to days owing to oxidation processes. The presence of FeII ions can be tested by spraying the freshly exposed soil surface with a 0.2-percent (M/V) , dipyridyl solution in 10-percent (V/V) acetic acid solution. The test yields a striking reddish-orange colour in the presence of Fe2+ ions but may not give the strong red colour in soil materials with a neutral or alkaline soil reaction. Care is necessary as the chemical is slightly toxic. Note for classification purposes An rH value of < 20 is diagnostic for reducing conditions in Gleysols, Planosols and Stagnosols, and stagnic and gleyic lower level units of other RSGs. Gaseous emissions (methane, carbon dioxide, etc.) are diagnostic for the Reductic qualifier.

Where a soil has a calcic horizon starting 50­10 cm from the soil surface, it is only a Calcisol if the soil matrix between 50 cm from the soil surface and the calcic horizon is calcareous throughout. Calcisols and Gypsisols can only have an argic horizon where the argic horizon is permeated with calcium carbonate (Calcisols) or calcium carbonate or gypsum (Gypsisols). GYPSUM Content of gypsum Gypsum (CaSO4·2H2O) may be found in the form of residues of gypsiric parent material or new formed features. The latter are pseudomycelia, coarse-sized crystals (individualized, as nests, beards or coatings, or as elongated groupings of fibrous crystals) or loose to compact powdery accumulations. The latter form gives the gypsic horizon a massive structure and a sandy texture. Where more readily soluble salts are absent, gypsum can be estimated in the field by measurements of electrical conductivity (EC in dS m-1) in soil suspensions of different soil­water relations (Table 40) after 30 minutes (in the case of finegrained gypsum). Forms of secondary gypsum The forms of secondary gypsum in soils are diverse and are considered to be informative for diagnostics of soil genesis.

READILY SOLUBLE SALTS Coastal or desert soils can be especially enriched with water-soluble salts or salts more soluble than gypsum (CaSO4·2H2O; log Ks = -4.85 at 25 °C). The salt content of the soil can be estimated roughly from an EC (in dS m-1 = mS cm-1) measured in a saturated soil paste or a more diluted suspension of soil in water (Richards, 1954). Conventionally, EC is measured in the laboratory in the saturation extract (ECSE). Most classification values and data about salt sensitivity of crops refer to ECSE. An easier and more comfortable method of determining EC in the field is to use a 20 g soil/50 ml H2O (aqua dest) suspension (EC2.5) and to calculate ECSE depending on the texture and content of organic matter (Table 42). Procedure Use a transparent plastic cup with marks for 8 cm3 soil (~ 10 g) and 25 ml water and mix carefully with a plastic stick. The EC is measured with a field conductometer after 30 minutes in the clear solution. Use water with an EC < 0.01 dS m-1. The salt content (NaCl equivalent) can be estimated from EC2.5 by: salt [%] = EC2.5 [mS cm-1] · 0.067 · 2.5. The EC2.5 can be converted to ECSE depending on the texture and content of humus according to the formula below and Table 43.

FIELD SOIL PH Soil pH expresses the activity of the hydrogen ions in the soil solution. It affects the availability of mineral nutrients to plants as well as many soil processes. When the pH is measured in the field, the method used should be indicated on the field data sheet. The field soil pH should not be a substitute for a laboratory determination. Field soil pH measurements should be correlated with laboratory determinations where possible. In the field, pH is either estimated using indicator papers, indicator liquids (e.g. Hellige), or measured with a portable pH meter in a soil suspension (1 part soil and 2.5 parts 1 M KCl or 0.1 M CaCl2 solution). After shaking the solution and waiting for 15 minutes, the pH value can be read. For the measurement, use a transparent 50ml plastic cup with marks for 8 cm3 soil (~ 10 g) and 25 ml solution.

ANDIC CHARACTERISTICS AND VOLCANIC GLASSES Soils formed from young volcanic materials often have andic properties: a bulk density of 0.9 kg dm-3 or less, and a smeary consistence (owing to higher contents of allophane and/or ferrihydrite). Surface horizons with andic characteristics are normally black because of high humus contents. Andic characteristics may be identified in the field using the pHNaF field test developed by Fieldes and Perrott (1966). A pHNaF of more than 9.5 indicates the presence of abundant allophanic products and/or organo-aluminium complexes. The method depends on active aluminium sorbing fluoride ions with subsequent release of OH+ ions. The test is indicative for most layers with andic properties, except for those very rich in organic matter. However, the same reaction occurs in spodic horizons and in certain acid clayey soils that are rich in aluminium-interlayered clay minerals; soils with free carbonates also react. Before applying a field NaF test, it is important to check soil pH (the test is not suitable for alkaline soils) and the presence of free carbonates (using HCl field test).
Presence of H2S (hydrogen sulphide; "rotten eggs"); commonly associated with strongly reduced soil containing sulphur compounds.

Procedure Place a small amount of soil material on a filter paper previously soaked in phenolphthalein and add some drops of 1 M NaF (adjusted to pH 7.5). A positive reaction is indicated by a fast change to an intense red colour. Alternatively, measure the pH of a suspension of 1 g soil in 50 ml 1 M NaF (adjusted to pH 7.5) after 2 minutes. If the pH is more than 9.5, it is a positive indication. Note in the description sheet the sign of a + or a -. In addition, soil material with andic characteristics may exhibit thixotropy; the soil material changes under pressure or by rubbing from a plastic solid into a liquefied stage and back into the solid condition. Note for classification purposes Positive field test for allophanic products and/or organo-aluminium complexes andic properties. Thixotropy Thixotropic qualifier. In many young volcanic materials, volcanic glasses, glassy aggregates and other glass-coated primary minerals occur. Coarser fractions may be checked by a ×10 hand-lens; finer fractions may be checked by microscope.

ORGANIC MATTER CONTENT Organic matter refers to all decomposed, partly decomposed and undecomposed organic materials of plant and animal origin. It is generally synonymous with humus although the latter is more commonly used when referring to the welldecomposed organic matter called humic substances. The content of organic matter of mineral horizons can be estimated from the Munsell colour of a dry and/or moist soil, taking the textural class into account (Table 46). This estimation is based on the assumption that the soil colour (value) is due to a mixture of dark coloured organic substances and light coloured minerals. This estimate does not work very well in strongly coloured subsoils. It tends to overestimate organic matter content in soils of dry regions, and to underestimate the organic matter content in some tropical soils. Therefore, the organic matter values should always be locally checked as they only provide a rough estimate.

ORGANIZATION OF SOIL CONSTITUENTS This section describes the primary physical organization of arrangement of the soil constituents, together with the consistence of the constituents. Primary organization is considered as being the overall arrangement of the soil mass without concentrations, reorientations and biological additions. It will not always be possible to make clear distinctions between primary and secondary elements of the organization. Voids (pores), which relate to the structural organization of soil, are described in a later section. Soil structure Soil structure refers to the natural organization of soil particles into discrete soil units (aggregates or peds) that result from pedogenic processes. The aggregates are separated from each other by pores or voids. It is preferred to describe the structure when the soil is dry or slightly moist. In moist or wet conditions, it is advisable to leave the description of structure to a later time when the soil has dried out. For the description of soil structure, a large lump of the soil should be taken from the profile, from various parts of the horizon if necessary, rather than observing the soil structure in situ. Soil structure is described in terms of grade, size and type of aggregates. Where a soil horizon contains aggregates of more than one grade, size or type, the different kinds of aggregates should be described separately and their relationship indicated. Grade In describing the grade or development of the structure, the first division is into apedal soils (lacking soil structure) and pedal soils (showing soil structure). In apedal or structureless soil, no aggregates are observable in place and there is no definite arrangement of natural surfaces of weakness. Structureless soils are subdivided into single grain and massive (see below). Single-grain soil material

has a loose, soft or very friable consistence and consists on rupture of more than 50 percent discrete mineral particles. Massive soil material normally has a stronger consistence and is more coherent on rupture. Massive soil material may be further defined by consistence (below) and porosity (below). Grades of structure of pedal soil materials are defined as per Table 47.
TABLE 47

Classification of structure of pedal soil materials
WE Weak Aggregates are barely observable in place and there is only a weak arrangement of natural surfaces of weakness. When gently disturbed, the soil material breaks into a mixture of few entire aggregates, many broken aggregates, and much material without aggregate faces. Aggregate surfaces differ in some way from the aggregate interior. Aggregates are observable in place and there is a distinct arrangement of natural surfaces of weakness. When disturbed, the soil material breaks into a mixture of many entire aggregates, some broken aggregates, and little material without aggregates faces. Aggregates surfaces generally show distinct differences with the aggregates interiors. Aggregates are clearly observable in place and there is a prominent arrangement of natural surfaces of weakness. When disturbed, the soil material separates mainly into entire aggregates. Aggregates surfaces generally differ markedly from aggregate interiors.

Size Size classes vary with the structure Subangular prismatic type. For prismatic, columnar and platy structures, the size classes refer to the measurements of the smallest dimension of the aggregate (Table 50). Combined classes may be constructed as per Table 51. Where a second structure is present, its relation to the first structure is described. The first and second structures may both be present (e.g. columnar and prismatic structures). The primary structure may break down into a secondary structure (e.g. prismatic breaking into angular blocky). The first structure may merge into the second structure (e.g. platy merging into prismatic). These can be indicated as per Table 52.

A platy structure and a surface crust Hyperochric qualifier. Stratification in  25 percent of the soil volume fluvic material. Consistence Consistence refers to the degree of cohesion or adhesion of the soil mass. It includes soil properties such as friability, plasticity, stickiness and resistance to compression. It depends greatly on the amount and type of clay, organic matter and moisture content of the soil. For reference descriptions (Status 1, Chapter 2), a recording of consistence is required for the dry, moist and wet (stickiness and plasticity) states. Where applicable, the smeariness (thixotropy) and fluidity may also be recorded. For routine descriptions, the soil consistence in the natural moisture condition of the profile may be described. Wet consistence can always be described, and moist conditions where the soil is dry, by adding water to the soil sample. Consistence when dry The consistence when dry (Table 53) is determined by breaking an air-dried mass of soil between thumb and forefinger or in the hand. Consistence when moist Consistence when moist (Table 54) is determined by attempting to crush a mass of moist or slightly moist soil material. Consistence when wet: maximum stickiness and maximum plasticity Soil stickiness depends on the extent to which soil structure is destroyed and on the amount of water present. The determination of stickiness should be performed under standard conditions on a soil sample in which structure is completely destroyed and which contains enough water to express its maximum stickiness. In this way, the maximum stickiness will be determined and comparison between degrees of stickiness of various soils will be feasible. The same principle applies to soil plasticity.

Extremely resistant to pressure; cannot be broken in the hands.

Note: Additional codes are: VFF, very friable to friable; FRF, friable to firm; and FVF, firm to very firm.

Stickiness is the quality of adhesion of the soil material to other objects determined by noting the adherence of soil material when it is pressed between thumb and finger (Table 55). Plasticity is the ability of soil material to change shape continuously under the influence of an applied stress and to retain the compressed shape on removal of stress. Determined by rolling the soil in the hands until a wire about 3 mm in diameter has been formed (Table 56).

After pressure, soil material adheres to both thumb and finger but comes off one or the other rather cleanly. It is not appreciably stretched when the digits are separated. After pressure, soil material adheres to both thumb and finger and tends to stretch somewhat and pull apart rather than pulling free from either digit. After pressure, soil material adheres strongly to both thumb and finger and is decidedly stretched when they are separated.

Soil-water status Soil-water status is the term used for the moisture condition of a horizon at the time the profile is described. The moisture status can be estimated in the field as per Table 57. Note for classification purposes The definitions of mineral and organic materials and of the histic, folic and cryic horizons depend on the soil-water status. Temporarily water-saturated Gelistagnic, Oxyaquic and Reductaquic qualifiers. Organic material floating on water Floatic qualifier. Permanently submerged under water < 2 m Subaquatic qualifier.

BULK DENSITY Bulk density is defined as the mass of a unit volume of dry soil (105 °C). This volume includes both solids and pores and, thus, bulk density reflects the total soil porosity. Low bulk density values (generally below 1.3 kg dm-3) generally indicate a porous soil condition. Bulk density is an important parameter for the description of soil quality and ecosystem function. High bulk density values indicate a poorer environment for root growth, reduced aeration, and undesirable changes in hydrologic function, such as reduced water infiltration. There are several methods of determining soil bulk density. One method is to obtain a known volume of soil, dry it to remove the water, and weigh the dry mass. Another uses a special coring instrument (cylindrical metal device) to obtain a sample of known volume without disturbing the natural soil structure, and then to determine the dry mass. For surface horizons, a simple method is to dig a small hole and fill it completely with a measured volume of sand. Field determinations of bulk density may be obtained by estimating the force required to push a knife into a soil horizon exposed at a field moist pit wall (Table 58).

In the plough pan, a bulk density 20 percent (relative) higher than that of the puddled layer anthraquic horizon. Root penetration is not only limited by bulk density, but also by texture. Fine-textured soils contain fewer pores in size and abundance than needed for unrestricted root growth. Therefore, the evaluation of bulk density has to take soil texture into account. For evaluation purposes the "packing density" (PD = BD + 0.009 ·% clay) can also be used (Figure 7).

Bulk density and volume of solids of organic soils may be estimated after the decomposition stage or the extent of peat drainage. Weakly drained and weakly decomposed peat materials are characterized by a lower bulk density and a lower solid volume than well-drained and strongly decomposed peat materials (Table 59). Organic surface horizons of mineral soils may be treated like strongly decomposed peat layers. VOIDS (POROSITY) Voids include all empty spaces in the soil. They are related to the arrangement of the primary soil constituents, rooting patterns, burrowing of animals or any other soil-forming processes, such as cracking, translocation and leaching. The term void is almost equivalent to the term pore, but the latter is often used in a more restrictive way and does not, for example, include fissures or planes. Voids are described in terms of type, size and abundance. In addition, continuity, orientation or any other feature may also be recorded. Porosity The porosity is an indication of the total volume of voids discernible with a ×10 hand-lens measured by area and recorded as the percentage of the surface occupied by pores (Table 60).

Subdivision possible into simple packing voids, which relate to the packing of sand particles, and compound packing voids, which result from the packing of non-accommodating peds. Predominantly irregular in shape and interconnected, and hard to quantify in the field. Discontinuous spherical or elliptical voids (chambers) of sedimentary origin or formed by compressed air, e.g. gas bubbles in slaking crusts after heavy rainfall. Relatively unimportant in connection with plant growth. Mostly irregular, equidimensional voids of faunal origin or resulting from tillage or disturbance of other voids. Discontinuous or interconnected. May be quantified in specific cases. Elongated voids of faunal or floral origin, mostly tubular in shape and continuous, varying strongly in diameter. When wider than a few centimetres (burrow holes), they are more adequately described under biological activity. Most planes are extra-pedal voids, related to accommodating ped surfaces or cracking patterns. They are often not persistent and vary in size, shape and quantity depending on the moisture condition of the soil. Planar voids may be recorded, describing width and frequency.

The major types of voids may be classified in a simplified way as per Table 61. In most cases, it is recommended that only the size and abundance of the channels, which are mostly continuous tubular pores, be described (Figure 8). For the other types of voids, the following size and abundance classes should serve as a guide for the construction of suitable classes for each category. Size The diameter of the elongated or tubular voids is described as per Table 62. Abundance The abundance of very fine and fine elongated pores as one group, and of medium and coarse pores as another group is recorded as the number per unit area in a square decimetre (Table 63). Note for classification purposes Vesicular layer below a platy layer or pavement with a vesicular layer yermic horizon. Sorted soil aggregates and vesicular pores anthraquic horizon.

Coatings This section describes clay or mixed-clay illuviation features, coatings of other composition (such as calcium carbonate, manganese, organic or silt), reorientations (such as slickensides and pressure faces), and concentrations associated with surfaces but occurring as stains in the matrix ("hypodermic coatings"). All these features are described according to their abundance, contrast, nature, form and location. Abundance For coatings, an estimate is made of how much of the ped or aggregate faces is covered (Table 64). Corresponding criteria should be applied when the cutanic feature is related to other surfaces (voids, and coarse fragments) or occurs as lamellae. Contrast Table 65 shows the classification of the contrast of coatings.

Chapter 4 ­ Soil description

55

Nature The nature of coatings may be described as per Table 66. Form For some coatings, the form may be informative for their genesis (Table 67). For example, manganese and iron­manganese coatings of dendroidal form indicate their formation owing to poor infiltration and periodically reductive conditions because of percolating water. Location The location of the coatings or clay accumulation is indicated (Table 68). For pressure faces and slickensides, no location is given because they are by definition located on pedfaces.

Roots The recording of both the size and the abundance of the roots is in general sufficient to characterize the distribution of roots in the profile. In specific cases, additional information can be noted, such as a sudden change in root orientation. The abundance of roots can only be compared within the same size class. The abundance of fine and very fine roots may be recorded similarly as for voids (Figure 8), expressed in the number of roots per decimetre square.

HUMAN-MADE MATERIALS With the growing human influence Pedotubules Termite or ant channels and nests in the world, especially in urban Other insect activity and mining areas, it becomes increasingly important to document the type and degree of influence. Of particular importance are the human-made materials found in soils. Their age, amount, state and composition determine to a large extent the duration of human influence and the environmental impact.
Earthworm channels

Artefacts Artefacts (IUSS Working Group WRB, 2006) are solid or liquid substances that are: (i) created or modified substantially by humans as part of an industrial or artisanal manufacturing process; or (ii) brought to the surface by human activity

Chapter 4 ­ Soil description

61

from a depth where they were not influenced by surface processes. They have properties substantially different from the environment where they are placed, and they have substantially the same properties as when first manufactured, modified or excavated. This definition has several implications: "Liquid" includes chemicals of industrial origin. It does not include mining overburden that has been influenced by surface processes or transported soil. It includes excavated natural solids and liquids, such as coal, spilled crude oil and bitumen. The human origin must be evident in the material itself, not from written records or inference. If it has been transformed so that its origin is no longer identifiable, it is no longer an artefact. Some examples of artefacts are: synthetic solids (compounds not found in nature): slag and plastic; synthetic liquids: creosote and refined hydrocarbons; waste liquids: sludges (e.g. brewery and municipal); natural materials recognizably reworked by humans: flint knives and arrowheads; natural materials processed by humans into a form or composition not found in nature: pottery, bricks, concrete, asphalt and lead shot; mixed materials: building rubble; industrial dusts (both natural and synthetic); pavements and paving stones; natural materials minimally processed but mixed in a way not found in nature: organic garbage. mine spoil or crude oil Note for classification purposes  20 percent (by volume, by weighted average) artefacts

Technosols.

Human-transported material (HTM) Human-transported material (HTM) is any material in the soil to be classified brought from "outside", often by machinery. This can be for agricultural purposes (e.g. large-scale terracing, mine spoil re-vegetation), for human settlement, or simply to dispose of material that is unwanted in its original location (e.g. dredgings). It is a parent material for pedogenesis, by analogy to fluvial sediments and colluvium. It has been defined as: "Human-transported material (abbreviation `HTM'): Any solid or liquid material moved into the soil from a source area outside of its immediate vicinity by intentional human activity, usually with the aid of machinery, without substantial reworking or displacement by natural forces" (Rossiter, 2004).

62

Guidelines for soil description

The definition has several implications: The restriction to "intentional" excludes dusts from wind erosion or mass movement (e.g. slumps) caused by human activity. The intention must be inferred from the type of material and manner of deposition, not from historical records. "Liquids" can be of any viscosity and include slurries, liquid manures, hydrocarbons and other industrial chemicals transported by humans. If material originally transported by humans has been further moved by natural forces, such as erosion (water or wind) or flooding, the human influence is reduced, and it is no longer HTM. It is a different substrate and could be referred to as e.g. "colluvium from HTM". Similarly, if the material is substantially reworked in situ (e.g. by frost), the human influence is reduced, and so it is no longer HTM. It could be referred to as "cyroturbated soil material originally human-transported". The requirement that materials be moved farther than from the "immediate vicinity" excludes materials from ditching, terracing, etc. where the transported material is placed as close as possible to the source; the "transportation" is too local. HTM may be mixed with non-transported material, e.g. spoil that is partially ploughed into underlying natural soil. Thus, a soil layer may consist of part HTM and part non-transported (but reworked in situ) material. HTM may have substantial pedogenesis and still be identified as such. HTMs may be identified in several ways: by evidence of deposition processes after transportation (e.g. voids, compaction, and disorganized fragments of diagnostic horizons); by artefacts (not always present), although isolated artefacts may be mixed into non-transported soil by ploughing or bioturbation; by absence of evidence of transportation by natural forces (e.g. layering from flooding) or reworking in situ (e.g. cryoturbation); by absence of pedogenesis that masks evidence of deposition. In each case, the classifier must state the specific evidence for HTM. Historical evidence, e.g. site plans, may be used as an indication of where to find HTM but it is not diagnostic; this is the same as for fluvic sediments, which must be identified only from morphology, not from records of flooding. Note for classification purposes HTM Transportic qualifier. Geomembranes and technic hard rock A geomembrane (IUSS Working Group WRB, 2006) is a synthetic membrane laid on the surface or into the soil or any other substrate. Many geomembranes are made of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) or high-density polyethylene (HDPE). Technic hard rock (IUSS Working Group WRB, 2006) is consolidated material resulting

Note for classification purposes A continuous, very slowly permeable to impermeable, constructed geomembrane starting within 100 cm of the soil surface Technosols with the Linic qualifier.

Abundance Abundance is described with the same rules as for rock fragments (above). Kind Table 83 lists the kinds of artefacts classified.

Description and determination of human-transported material Where HTM is dominant, i.e. it occupies more than 50 percent (by volume) of the soil, it is sufficient to identify the type of HTM. Use the determination table (Table 84) and record the code. SAMPLING The sample code and sampling depth are given. It is recommended that the number given to the sample be the profile number followed by an additional capital letter (A, B, C, D, etc.) and depth range at which each sample has been collected from top to bottom, regardless of the horizon they are taken from (some may not be sampled while others may be sampled twice). Samples are never taken across horizon boundaries. The weight of material taken for each sample is usually 1 kg. Horizon symbols should not be used as sample codes because the horizon classifications may be changed later.

Chapter 4 ­ Soil description

65

There are basically two methods of collecting samples: To collect the sample in equal proportions over the whole horizon. This is the recommended method and should be used for reference (Status 1) descriptions where a dense sampling is required. To take the sample in equal proportions within a depth of 20 cm, either from the centre (area of maximum expression) of the horizon, or, if more than one sample is to be taken from the same horizon, at balanced intervals. In both methods, the boundary area itself should not be sampled. In detailed descriptions of soils with horizons no more than 30­40 cm thick, there will be little difference between the two methods in practice. It is recommended that the topsoil be sampled within the first 20 cm of the surface, or shallower where the horizon depth is less. This will facilitate comparison of topsoil characteristics in soil inventories and land evaluation. If the presence of a mollic horizon is assumed, the sampling depth for a soil with a solum more than 60 cm thick may be more than 20 cm but not exceeding 30 cm. Depth criteria of diagnostic horizons and properties should be taken into account in determining the depth of sampling. To indicate the occurrence of an argic horizon that is defined as having a specified clay increase over a vertical distance of 15 or 30 cm, the samples are preferably taken at that depth interval (e.g. A 0­20 cm, B 20­30 cm or 30­50 cm). Another example is for the classification of Nitisols: a sample should be taken at a depth of 140­160 cm, in addition to the one taken from that part of the B horizon where the clay content is assumed to be highest.

Genetic and systematic interpretation ­ soil classification

SOIL HORIZON DESIGNATION The soil horizon designation summarizes many observations of the soil description and gives an impression about the genetic processes that have formed the soil under observation. In this chapter, the soil morphological and other characteristics are presented as they are described by horizon. Horizon symbols consist of one or two capital letters for the master horizon and lower case letter suffixes for subordinate distinctions, with or without a figure suffix. For the presentation and understanding of the soil profile description, it is essential that correct horizon symbols be given. Master horizons and layers The capital letters H, O, A, E, B, C, R, I, L and W represent the master horizons or layers in soils or associated with soils. The capital letters are the base symbols to which other characters are added in order to complete the designation. Most horizons and layers are given a single capital letter symbol, but some require two. Currently, ten master horizons and layers and seven transitional horizons are recognized. The master horizons and their subdivisions represent layers that show evidence of change and some layers that have not been changed. Most are genetic soil horizons, reflecting a qualitative judgement about the kind of changes that have taken place. Genetic horizons are not equivalent to diagnostic horizons, although they may be identical in soil profiles. Diagnostic horizons are quantitatively defined features used in classification. Three additional layers associated with some soils are identified, viz. I for ice, L for limnic materials, and W for water layers. H horizons or layers These are layers dominated by organic material formed from accumulations of undecomposed or partially decomposed organic material at the soil surface, which may be underwater. All H horizons are saturated with water for prolonged periods, or were once saturated but are now drained artificially. An H horizon may be on top of mineral soils or at any depth beneath the surface if it is buried.

68

Guidelines for soil description

O horizons or layers These are layers dominated by organic material consisting of undecomposed or partially decomposed litter, such as leaves, needles, twigs, moss and lichens, that has accumulated on the surface; they may be on top of either mineral or organic soils. O horizons are not saturated with water for prolonged periods. The mineral fraction of such material is only a small percentage of the volume of the material and is generally much less than half of the weight. An O layer may be at the surface of a mineral soil or at any depth beneath the surface where it is buried. A horizon formed by illuviation of organic material into mineral subsoil is not an O horizon, although some horizons formed in this manner contain much organic matter. A horizons These are mineral horizons that formed at the surface or below an O horizon, in which all or much of the original rock structure has been obliterated and which are characterized by one or more of the following: an accumulation of humified organic matter intimately mixed with the mineral fraction and not displaying properties characteristic of E or B horizons (see below); properties resulting from cultivation, pasturing, or similar kinds of disturbance; a morphology that is different from the underlying B or C horizon, resulting from processes related to the surface. If a surface horizon (or epipedon) has properties of both A and E horizons but the dominant feature is an accumulation of humified organic matter, it is designated an A horizon. In some places, where warm and arid climates prevail, the undisturbed surface horizon is less dark than the underlying horizon and contains only small amounts of organic matter. It has a morphology distinct from the C layer, although the mineral fraction may be unaltered or only slightly altered by weathering. Such a horizon is designated A because it is at the surface. Examples of epipedons that may have a different structure or morphology owing to surface processes are Vertisols, soils in pans or playas with little vegetation, and soils in deserts. However, recent alluvial or aeolian deposits that retain fine stratification are not considered to be an A horizon unless cultivated. E horizons These are mineral horizons in which the main feature is loss of silicate clay, iron, aluminium, or some combination of these, leaving a concentration of sand and silt particles, and in which all or much of the original rock structure has been obliterated. An E horizon is usually, but not necessarily, lighter in colour than an underlying B horizon. In some soils, the colour is that of the sand and silt particles, but in many soils coatings of iron oxides or other compounds mask the colour of

Chapter 5 ­ Genetic and systematic interpretation ­ soil classification

69

the primary particles. An E horizon is most commonly differentiated from an underlying B horizon in the same soil profile: by colour of higher value or lower chroma, or both; by coarser texture; or by a combination of these properties. An E horizon is commonly near the surface, below an O or A horizon and above a B horizon. However, the symbol E may be used without regard to position in the profile for any horizon that meets the requirements and that has resulted from soil genesis. B horizons These are horizons that formed below an A, E, H or O horizon, and in which the dominant features are the obliteration of all or much of the original rock structure, together with one or a combination of the following: illuvial concentration, alone or in combination, of silicate clay, iron, aluminium, humus, carbonates, gypsum or silica; evidence of removal of carbonates; residual concentration of sesquioxides; coatings of sesquioxides that make the horizon conspicuously lower in value, higher in chroma, or redder in hue than overlying and underlying horizons without apparent illuviation of iron; alteration that forms silicate clay or liberates oxides or both and that forms a granular, blocky or prismatic structure if volume changes accompany changes in moisture content;
brittleness.

All kinds of B horizons are, or were originally, subsurface horizons. Included as B horizons are layers of illuvial concentration of carbonates, gypsum or silica that are the result of pedogenetic processes (these layers may or may not be cemented) and brittle layers that have other evidence of alteration, such as prismatic structure or illuvial accumulation of clay. Examples of layers that are not B horizons are: layers in which clay films either coat rock fragments or are on finely stratified unconsolidated sediments, whether the films were formed in place or by illuviation; layers into which carbonates have been illuviated but that are not contiguous to an overlying genetic horizon; and layers with gleying but no other pedogenetic changes. C horizons or layers These are horizons or layers, excluding hard bedrock, that are little affected by pedogenetic processes and lack properties of H, O, A, E or B horizons. Most are mineral layers, but some siliceous and calcareous layers, such as shells, coral and diatomaceous earth, are included. The material of C layers may be either like or unlike that from which the solum presumably formed. A C horizon may have been modified even where there is no evidence of pedogenesis. Plant roots can penetrate C horizons, which provide an important growing medium. Included as C layers are sediments, saprolite, and unconsolidated bedrock and other geological materials that commonly slake within 24 hours when air dry or

70

Guidelines for soil description

drier chunks are placed in water and when moist can be dug with a spade. Some soils form in material that is already highly weathered, and such material that does not meet the requirements of A, E or B horizons is designated C. Changes not considered pedogenetic are those not related to overlying horizons. Layers having accumulations of silica, carbonates or gypsum, even if indurated, may be included in C horizons unless the layer is obviously affected by pedogenetic processes; then it is a B horizon. R layers These consist of hard bedrock underlying the soil. Granite, basalt, quartzite and indurated limestone or sandstone are examples of bedrock that are designated R. Air-dry or drier chunks of an R layer when placed in water will not slake within 24 hours. The R layer is sufficiently coherent when moist to make hand digging with a spade impractical, although it may be chipped or scraped. Some R layers can be ripped with heavy power equipment. The bedrock may contain cracks, but these are so few and so small that few roots can penetrate. The cracks may be coated or filled with clay or other material. I layers These are ice lenses and wedges that contain at least 75 percent ice (by volume) and that distinctly separate organic or mineral layers in the soil. Ice comes and goes in soils in areas affected by permafrost. Ice bodies in soils can grow to such an extent that they form lenses of wedges that separate entire soil layers. In case such, where ice concentrations occur within the depth of soil description, they can be designated as an I layer. The I symbol is not used in transitional horizon designations. L layers These are sediments deposited in a body of water (subaqueous) composed of both organic and inorganic materials, also known as limnic material. Limnic material is either: (i) deposited by precipitation or through action of aquatic organisms, such as algae or diatoms; or (ii) derived from underwater and floating aquatic plants and subsequently modified by aquatic animals (USDA Soil Survey Staff, 2003). L layers include coprogenous earth or sedimentary peat (mostly organic), diatomaceous earth (mostly siliceous), and marl (mostly calcareous). The L symbol is not used in transitional horizon designations. W layers These are water layers in soils or water submerging soils, either permanently or cyclic within the time frame of 24 hours. Some organic soils float on water. In such cases, the W symbol may be used at the end of the soil description to indicate the floating character. In other cases, shallow water (i.e. water not deeper than 1 m) may cover the soil permanently, as in the case of shallow lakes, or cyclic, as in tidal flats. The symbol W is then used

Chapter 5 ­ Genetic and systematic interpretation ­ soil classification

71

to indicate the depth of submergence at the start of the horizon or layer sequence. The occurrence of tidal water can be indicated by (W). Transitional horizons There are two kinds of transitional horizons: those with properties of two horizons superimposed; and those with the two properties separate. For horizons dominated by properties of one master horizon but having subordinate properties of another, two capital letter symbols are used, such as AB, EB, BE and BC. The master horizon symbol that is given first designates the kind of horizon whose properties dominate the transitional horizon. For example, an AB horizon has characteristics of both an overlying A horizon and an underlying B horizon, but it is more like the A than like the B. In some cases, a horizon can be designated as transitional even if one of the master horizons to which it is apparently transitional is not present. A BE horizon may be recognized in a truncated soil if its properties are similar to those of a BE horizon in a soil in which the overlying E horizon has not been removed by erosion. An AB or a BA horizon may be recognized where bedrock underlies the transitional horizon. A BC horizon may be recognized even if no underlying C horizon is present; it is transitional to assumed parent material. A CR horizon can be used for weathered bedrock that can be dug with a spade although roots cannot penetrate except along fracture planes. Horizons in which distinct parts have recognizable properties of two kinds of master horizons are indicated as above, but the two capital letters are separated by a virgule (/), such as E/B, B/E, B/C and C/R. Commonly, most of the individual parts of one of the components are surrounded by the other. The I, L and W symbols are not used in transitional horizon designations. Subordinate characteristics within master horizons and layers Designations of subordinate distinctions and features within the master horizons and layers are based on profile characteristics observable in the field and are applied during the description of the soil at the site. Lower case letters are used as suffixes to designate specific kinds of master horizons and layers, and other features. The list of symbols and terms is shown in Table 85 and explanations of them are given below: a. Highly decomposed organic material: Used with H and O horizons only, to indicate the state of decomposition of the organic material. Highly decomposed organic material has less than one-sixth (by volume) visible plant remains. b. Buried genetic horizon: Used in mineral soils to indicate identifiable buried horizons with major genetic features that were formed before burial. Genetic horizons may or may not have formed in the overlying materials, which may be either like or unlike the assumed parent materials of the buried soil. The symbol is not used in organic soils or to separate an organic layer from a mineral layer, in cryoturbated soils, or with C horizons.

Moderately decomposed organic materials: Used with H and O horizons only, to indicate the state of decomposition of the organic material. Moderately decomposed organic material has between one-sixth and twothirds (by volume) visible plant remains. f. Frozen soil: Designates horizons or layers that contain permanent ice or are perennially colder than 0 °C. It is not used for seasonally frozen layers or for bedrock layers (R). If needed, "dry frozen soil" layers may be labelled (f). g. Stagnic conditions: Designates horizons in which a distinct pattern of mottling occurs that reflects alternating conditions of oxidation and reduction of sesquioxides, caused by seasonal surface waterlogging. If aggregates are present, the interiors of the aggregates show oxidizing colours and the surface parts reducing colours. h. Accumulation of organic matter: Designates the accumulation of organic matter in mineral horizons. The accumulation may occur in surface horizons, or in subsurface horizons through illuviation. i. Slickensides: Denotes in mineral soils the occurrence of slickensides, i.e. oblique shear faces 20­60 º of horizontal owing to the shrink­swell action of clay; wedge-shaped peds and seasonal surface cracks are commonly present. Slightly decomposed organic material: In organic soils and used in combination with H or O horizons, it indicates the state of decomposition of the organic material; slightly decomposed organic material has in more than two-thirds (by volume) visible plant remains. j. Jarosite: Indicates the presence of jarosite mottles, coatings or hypodermic coatings. k. Accumulation of pedogenetic carbonates: Indicates an accumulation of alkaline earth carbonates, commonly calcium carbonate. l. Capillary fringe mottling: Indicates mottling caused by ascending groundwater. If aggregates are present, the interiors of the aggregates show reducing colours and the surface parts oxidizing colours. Strong cementation or induration: Indicates in mineral soils continuous or nearly continuous cementation, and is used only for horizons that are more than 90 percent cemented, although they may be fractured. The layer is root restrictive and roots do not enter except along fracture planes. The single predominant or codominant cementing agent may be indicated using defined letter suffices single or in pairs. If the horizon is cemented by carbonates km is used; by silica, qm; by iron, sm; by gypsum, ym; by both lime and silica, kqm; and by salts more soluble than gypsum, zm. Marl: In combination with limnic material it is used to indicate marl, i.e. materials deposited under water and dominated by a mixture of clay and calcium carbonate; typically grey in colour. n. Pedogenetic accumulation of exchangeable sodium: Indicates an accumulation of exchangeable sodium.

o. Residual accumulation of sesquioxides: Indicates residual accumulation of sesquioxides. It differs from the use of symbol s, which indicates illuvial accumulation of organic matter and sesquioxide complexes. p. Ploughing or other human disturbance: Indicates disturbance of the surface layer by ploughing or other tillage practices. A disturbed organic horizon is designated Op or Hp. A disturbed mineral horizon, even though clearly once an E, B or C, is designated Ap. q. Accumulation of pedogenetic silica: Indicates an accumulation of secondary silica. If silica cements the layer and cementation is continuous or nearly continuous, qm is used. r. Strong reduction: Indicates presence of iron in reduced state. If r is used with B, pedogenetic change in addition to reduction is implied; if no other change has taken place, the horizon is designated Cr. s. Illuvial accumulation of sesquioxides: Used with B to indicate the accumulation of illuvial, amorphous, dispersible organic matter­sesquioxide complexes if the value and chroma of the horizon are more than 3. The symbol is also used in combination with h as Bhs if both the organic matter and sesquioxides components are significant and both value and chroma are about 3 or less. t. Accumulation of silicate clay: Used with B or C to indicate an accumulation of silicate clay that either has formed in the horizon or has been moved into it by illuviation, or both. At least some part should show evidence of clay accumulation in the form of coatings on ped surfaces or in pores, as lamellae, or as bridges between mineral grains. u. Urban and other human-made materials: Used to indicate the dominant presence of human-made materials, including technogenic ones. The symbol can be used in combination with H, O, A, E, B and C. v. Occurrence of plinthite: Indicates the presence of iron-rich, humus-poor material that is firm or very firm when moist and that hardens irreversibly when exposed to the atmosphere. When hardened, it is no longer called plinthite but a hardpan, ironstone, a petroferric or a skeletic phase. In that case, v is used in combination with m. w.Development of colour or structure in B: Used with B only to indicate development of colour or structure, or both. It is not used to indicate a transitional horizon. x. Fragipan characteristics: Used to indicate genetically developed firmness, brittleness or high bulk density. These features are characteristic of fragipans, but some horizons designated x do not have all the properties of a fragipan. y. Pedogenetic accumulation of gypsum: Indicates an accumulation of gypsum. z. Pedogenetic accumulation of salts more soluble than gypsum: Indicates an accumulation of salts more soluble than gypsum. @ Evidence of cryoturbation: irregular or broken boundaries, sorted rock fragments (patterned ground), or organic matter in the lower boundary

between the active layer and permafrost layer. The suffix is always used last, e.g. Hi@. Conventions for using letter suffixes Many master horizons and layers that are symbolized by a single capital letter will have one or more lowercase letter suffixes. More than three suffixes are rarely used. The following rules apply: Letter suffixes should follow the capital letter immediately. When more than one suffix is needed, the following letters, if used, are written first: r, s, t, u and w. The symbol t has precedence over all other symbols, e.g. Btr, Btu. In all other combinations, the symbols are listed alphabetically, e.g. Cru. If more than one suffix is needed and the horizon is not buried, these symbols, if used, are written last: c, f, g, m, v and x. Some examples: Btc, Bkm, and Bsv. If a horizon is buried, the suffix b is written last. A B horizon that has significant accumulation of clay and also shows evidence of development of colour or structure, or both, is designated Bt (t has precedence over w, s and h). A B horizon that is gleyed or that has accumulations of carbonates, sodium, silica, gypsum, salts more soluble than gypsum, or residual accumulation or sesquioxides carries the appropriate symbol g, k, n, q, y, z or o. If illuvial clay is also present, t precedes the other symbols, e.g. Bto. Suffixes h, s and w are normally not used with g, k, n, q, y, z or o unless needed for explanatory purposes. Suffixes a and e are used only in combination with H or O. Suffixes c, d, i and m have two different meanings, depending on the master horizon designation they are coupled to. The different combinations are mutually exclusive, e.g. Bi indicates presence of slickensides in the B horizon, whereas Hi indicates a slightly decomposed H horizon. Similarly, Bd indicates a dense B horizon, and Ld diatomaceous earth in a limnic layer. Suffix @ is always used last, and cannot be combined with b. Unless otherwise indicated, suffixes are listed alphabetically. Vertical subdivisions Horizons or layer designated by a single combination of letter symbols can be subdivided using Arabic numerals, which follow all the letters. For example, within a C, successive layers could be C1, C2, C3, etc.; or if the lower part is gleyed and the upper part is not, the designations could be C1-C2-Cg1-Cg2 or C-Cg1-Cg2-R. These conventions apply whatever the purpose of subdivision. A horizon identified by a single set of letter symbol may be subdivided on the basis of evident morphological features, such as structure, colour or texture. These subdivisions are numbered consecutively. The numbering starts with 1 at whatever level in the

76

Guidelines for soil description

profile. Thus, Bt1-Bt2-Btk1-Btk2 is used, not Bt1-Bt2-Btk3-Btk4. The numbering of vertical subdivisions within a horizon is not interrupted at a discontinuity (indicated by a numerical prefix) if the same letter combination is used in both materials: Bs1-Bs2-2Bs3-2Bs4 is used, not Bs1-Bs2-2Bs1-2Bs2. A and E horizons can be subdivided similarly, e.g. Ap, A1, A2; Ap1, Ap2; A1, A2, A3; and E1, E2, Eg1, Eg2. Discontinuities In mineral soils, Arabic numerals are used as prefixes to indicate discontinuities. Wherever needed, they are used preceding A, E, B, C and R. They are not used with I and W, although these symbols clearly indicate a discontinuity. These prefixes are distinct from Arabic numerals used as suffixes to denote vertical subdivisions. A discontinuity is a significant change in particle-size distribution or mineralogy that indicates a difference in the material from which the horizons formed or a significant difference in age or both, unless that difference in age is indicated by the suffix b. Symbols to identify discontinuities are used only when they will contribute substantially to the reader's understanding of relationships among horizons. The stratification common in soils formed in alluvium is not designated as discontinuities unless particle-size distribution differs markedly from layer to layer even though genetic horizons have formed in the contrasting layers. Where a soil has formed entirely in one kind of material, a prefix is omitted from the symbol; the whole profile is material 1. Similarly, the uppermost material in a profile having two or more contrasting materials is understood to be material 1, but the number is omitted. Numbering starts with the second layer of contrasting material, which is designated 2. Underlying contrasting layers are numbered consecutively. Even where a layer below material 2 is similar to material 1, it is designated 3 in the sequence. The numbers indicate a change in the material, not the type of material. Where two or more consecutive horizons formed in one kind of material, the same prefix number applies to all of the horizon designations in that material: Ap-E-Bt1-2Bt2-2Bt3-2BC. The number suffixes designating subdivisions of the Bt horizon continue in consecutive order across the discontinuity. If an R layer is below a soil that formed in residuum and the material of the R layer is judged to be like that from which the material of the soil weathered, the Arabic number prefix is not used. If the R layer would not produce material like that in the solum, the number prefix is used, as in A-Bt-C-2R or A-Bt-2R. If part of the solum formed in residuum, R is given the appropriate prefix: Ap-Bt1-2Bt22Bt3-2C1-2C2-2R. Buried horizons (designated b) are special problems. A buried horizon is not the same deposit as horizons in the overlying deposit. However, some buried horizons formed in material lithological like that of the overlying deposit. A prefix is not used to distinguish material of such buried horizons. If the material in which a horizon of a buried soil formed is lithological unlike that of the

Chapter 5 ­ Genetic and systematic interpretation ­ soil classification

77

overlying material, the discontinuity is designated by number prefixes and the symbol for a buried horizon is used as well: Ap-Bt1-Bt2-BC-C-2ABb-2Btb12Btb2-2C. In organic soils, discontinuities between different kinds of layers are not identified. In most cases, the differences are shown by the letter suffix designations, if the different layers are organic, or by the master symbol if the different layers are mineral. Use of the prime Identical designations may be appropriate for two or more horizons or layers separated by at least one horizon or layer of a more different kind in the same pedon. The sequence A-E-Bt-E-Btx-C is an example ­ the soil has two E horizons. To make communication easier, a prime is used with the master horizon symbol of the lower of two horizons having identical letter designations: A-E-Bt-E'-Btx-C. The prime is applied to the capital letter designation, and any lower case symbol follows it: B't. The prime is not used unless all letters of the designations of two different layers are identical. Rarely, three layers have identical letter symbols; a double prime can be used: E''. The same principle applies in designating layers of organic soils. The prime is used only to distinguish two or more horizons that have identical symbols: O-C-C'-C''. The prime is added to the lower C layer to differentiate it from the upper. PRINCIPLES OF CLASSIFICATION ACCORDING TO THE WRB The surveyor should attempt to classify the soil in the field as precisely as possible on the basis of the soil morphological features that have been observed and described. The final classification is made after the analytical data have become available. It is recommended that the occurrence and depth of diagnostic horizons, properties and materials identified be listed (below). The general principles on which the classification according to the WRB is based (IUSS Working Group WRB 2006)can be summarized as follows: The classification of soils is based on soil properties defined in terms of diagnostic horizons, properties and materials, which to the greatest extent possible should be measurable and observable in the field. The selection of diagnostic characteristics takes into account their relationship with soil forming processes. It is recognized that an understanding of soilforming processes contributes to a better characterization of soils but that they should not, as such, be used as differentiating criteria. To the extent possible at a high level of generalization, diagnostic features are selected that are of significance for soil management. Climate parameters are not applied in the classification of soils. It is fully realized that they should be used for interpretation purposes, in dynamic combination with soil properties, but they should not form part of soil definitions.

78

Guidelines for soil description

The WRB is a comprehensive classification system that enables people to

accommodate their national classification system. It comprises two tiers of categorical detail: · the Reference Base, limited to the first level only and having 32 RSGs; · the WRB Classification System, consisting of combinations of a set of prefix and suffix qualifiers that are uniquely defined and added to the name of the RSG, allowing very precise characterization and classification of individual soil profiles. Many RSGs in the WRB are representative of major soil regions so as to provide a comprehensive overview of the world's soil cover. The Reference Base is not meant to substitute for national soil classification systems but rather to serve as a common denominator for communication at an international level. This implies that lower-level categories, possibly a third category of the WRB, could accommodate local diversity at country level. Concurrently, the lower levels emphasize soil features that are important for land use and management. The Revised Legend of the FAO/UNESCO Soil Map of the World (FAO, 1988) has been used as a basis for the development of the WRB in order to take advantage of international soil correlation that has already been conducted through this project and elsewhere. The first edition of the WRB, published in 1998, comprised 30 RSGs; the second edition, published in 2006, has 32 RSGs. Definitions and descriptions of soil units reflect variations in soil characteristics both vertically and laterally in order to account for spatial linkages within the landscape. The term Reference Base is connotative of the common denominator function that the WRB assumes. Its units have sufficient width to stimulate harmonization and correlation of existing national systems. In addition to serving as a link between existing classification systems, the WRB also serves as a consistent communication tool for compiling global soil databases and for the inventory and monitoring of the world's soil resources. The nomenclature used to distinguish soil groups retains terms that have been used traditionally or that can be introduced easily in current language. They are defined precisely in order to avoid the confusion that occurs where names are used with different connotations. Although the basic framework of the FAO Legend (with its two categorical levels and guidelines for developing classes at a third level) was adopted, it has been decided to merge the lower levels. Each RSG of the WRB is provided with a listing of possible prefix and suffix qualifiers in a priority sequence, from which the user can construct the second-level units. The broad principles that govern the WRB class differentiation are: At the higher categorical level, classes are differentiated mainly according to the primary pedogenetic process that has produced the characteristic soil features, except where special soil parent materials are of overriding importance.

Chapter 5 ­ Genetic and systematic interpretation ­ soil classification

79

At the second level, soil units are differentiated according to any secondary

soil-forming process that has affected the primary soil features significantly. In certain cases, soil characteristics that have a significant effect on use may be taken into account. It is recognized that a number of RSGs may occur under different climate conditions. However, it was decided not to introduce separations on account of climate characteristics so that the classification of soils is not subordinated to the availability of climate data. Including the soil description, classification is done in four steps. Step 1 The profile description is checked to find references to soil-forming processes (qualitatively) and express them in the horizon designation. Examples may be: Darkening of topsoil in comparison to subsoil enrichment with organic material Ah-horizon. Browning and finer texture in the middle part of a soil profile in comparison to the parent material enrichment of Fe-oxides and clay weathering Bw-horizon. Step 2 The profile description and the horizon designation are to be checked whether the expression, thickness and depth of certain soil characteristics correspond with the requirements of WRB diagnostic horizons, properties and materials. These are defined in terms of morphological characteristics and/or analytical criteria (IUSS Working Group WRB, 2006). In line with the WRB objectives, attributes are described as much as possible to support field identification. Step 3 The described combination of diagnostic horizons, properties and materials is compared with the WRB Key (IUSS Working Group WRB, 2006) in order to find the RSG, which is the first level of WRB classification. The user should go through the Key systematically, starting at the beginning and excluding one by one all RSGs for which the specified requirements are not met. The soil belongs to the first RSG for which it meets all specified requirements. Step 4 For the second level of WRB classification, qualifiers are used. The qualifiers are listed in the Key with each RSG as prefix and suffix qualifiers. Prefix qualifiers comprise those that are typically associated to the RSG and the intergrades to other RSGs. All other qualifiers are listed as suffix qualifiers. For classification at the second level, all applying qualifiers have to be added to the name of the RSG. Redundant qualifiers (the characteristics of which are included in a previously set qualifier) are not added.

80

Guidelines for soil description

Specifiers can be used to indicate the degree of expression of qualifiers. Buried layers can be indicated by the Thapto- specifier, which can be used with any qualifier, listed in IUSS Working Group WRB (2006). Where a soil is buried under new material, the following rules apply: 1. The overlying new material and the buried soil are classified as one soil if both together qualify as Histosol, Technosol, Cryosol, Leptosol, Vertisol, Fluvisol, Gleysol, Andosol, Planosol, Stagnosol or Arenosol. 2. Otherwise, the new material is classified at the first level if the new material is 50 cm or more thick or if the new material, if it stood alone, fits the requirements of a RSG other than a Regosol. 3. In all other cases, the buried soil is classified at the first level. 4. If the overlying soil is classified at the first level, the buried soil is recognized with the Thapto- specifier and -ic added to the RSG name of the buried soil. The whole is placed in brackets after the name of the overlying soil, e.g. Technic Umbrisol (Greyic) (Thapto-Podzolic). If the buried soil is classified at the first level, the overlying material is indicated with the Novic qualifier. Principles and use of the qualifiers in the WRB A two-tier system is used for the qualifier level, comprising: Prefix qualifiers: typically associated qualifiers and intergrade qualifiers; the sequence of the intergrade qualifiers follows that of the RSGs in the WRB Key, with the exception of Arenosols; this intergrade is ranked with the textural suffix qualifiers (see below). Haplic closes the prefix qualifier list indicating that neither typically associated nor intergrade qualifiers apply. Suffix qualifiers: other qualifiers, sequenced as follows: (1) qualifiers related to diagnostic horizons, properties or materials; (2) qualifiers related to chemical characteristics; (3) qualifiers related to physical characteristics; (4) qualifiers related to mineralogical characteristics; (5) qualifiers related to surface characteristics; (6) qualifiers related to textural characteristics, including coarse fragments; (7) qualifiers related to colour; and (8) remaining qualifiers. Prefix qualifier names are always put before the RSG; suffix qualifier names are always placed between brackets following the RSG name. Combinations of qualifiers that indicate a similar status or duplicate each other are not permitted, such as combinations of Thionic and Dystric, Calcaric and Eutric, or Rhodic and Chromic. Specifiers such as Epi-, Endo-, Hyper-, Hypo-, Thapto-, Bathy-, Para-, Proto-, Cumuli- and Ortho- are used to indicate a certain expression of the qualifier. When classifying a soil profile, all applying qualifiers of the listing must be recorded. For mapping purposes, the scale will determine the number of qualifiers used. In that case, prefix qualifiers have priority over the suffix qualifiers. The qualifier listing for each RSG accommodates most cases. Where not listed qualifiers are needed, the cases should be documented and reported to the WRB Working Group.

The field classification provides a preliminary assessment using all observable or easily measurable properties and features of the soil and associated terrain. The final classification is made when analytical data are available. It is recommended that Procedures for Soil Analysis (Van Reeuwijk, 2006) be followed in determining chemical and physical characteristics. Example of WRB soil classification A soil has a ferralic horizon; texture in the upper part of the ferralic horizon changes from sandy loam to sandy clay within 15 cm. The pH is between 5.5 and 6, indicating moderate to high base saturation. The B horizon is dark red; below 50 cm, mottling occurs. The field classification of this soil is: Lixic Ferralsol (Ferric, Rhodic). If subsequent laboratory analysis reveals that the cation exchange capacity of the ferralic horizon is less than 4 cmolc kg-1 clay, the soil finally classifies as: Lixic Vetic Ferralsol (Ferric, Rhodic). CHECKLIST OF WRB DIAGNOSTIC HORIZONS, PROPERTIES AND MATERIALS While still in the field, it is advisable to determine or estimate, for each horizon, the diagnostic characteristics that apply to the classification system used. Table 86 provides a checklist of diagnostic horizons, properties and materials in the order as they appear in the WRB (IUSS Working Group WRB, 2006).

Guidelines for soil description

APPENDING TEXTURE AND PARENT MATERIAL INFORMATION TO THE REFERENCE SOIL GROUP In its present state, the WRB (IUSS Working Group WRB, 2006) is, by history and practical purposes, mixing information about soil genesis (e.g. podzolization ­ Podzol, gleysation ­ Gleysol), texture (e.g. Arenosol, skeletic, arenic, siltic, and clayic subunits), parent materials (e.g. Anthrosols, Fluvisols, calcaric, and gypsiric subunits) and others. The system distinguishes second-level units only in a generalized manner by texture and only in the parent material of some RSGs. In order to overcome this problem and to provide users with more systematic and precise information about texture, parent material and layering, the following framework for a reference soil series is recommended (Jahn, 2004). Example A Cambisol to which only the Dystric qualifier applies and which has variations in texture and in which the upper part has developed from loess with some fluvial gravelly sand and the lower part has developed from glacio-fluvial gravelly sand. The full description is: Haplic Cambisol (Dystric); silt loam from loess with glacio-fluvial gravelly sand over sandy skeleton from glacio-fluvial gravel It is coded: CMdy; SiL(UE2, UG2)/SSK(UG3) 1 2 3 45 1 = Coding of soil unit according to the WRB (IUSS Working Group WRB, 2006). 2 = Coding of texture class for the upper part of the soil body. The texture class for the fine earth is used according to Chapter 4 and combined with four classes of coarse fragments, e.g.: SiL = silt loam with coarse fragments < 10 percent (by volume); skSiL= skeletal silt loam with coarse fragments of from 10 to < 40 percent (by volume); silSK = silt loamy skeleton with coarse fragments of from 40 to <80 percent (by volume); SK = skeleton with coarse fragments of 80 percent or more (by volume). 3 = The parent material is given in descending order of importance from left to right within brackets. For coding, an extended hierarchical lithology list, based on updated SOTER (ISRIC, 2005) is used. 4 = A change of material with depth (either by texture or by parent material or by both is coded with: ...\... as "shallow ... over ..." where occurring at a depth of 0­3 dm; .../... as "... over ..." where occurring at a depth of 3­7 dm; (the intermediate of 5 dm is corresponding with the WRB-epi and -endo); ...//... as "... over deep ..." where occurring at a depth of 7­12 dm. 5 = The lower part of the soil body is described according to 2 and 3.

Chapter 5 ­ Genetic and systematic interpretation ­ soil classification

83

Further rules in describing texture and parent material are: e.g.: skSiL(UE2, UG2/UG3) where no change in texture but in parent material; e.g.: SiL/skSiL(UE2, UG3) where no change in parent material but in texture; e.g.: .../R(and lithology) means: over massive rock; Horizons are combined to one complex and described with the average where not more than one of the three parameters: (1) texture (fine earth); (2) coarse fragments; and (3) lithology differs for one class. Thin (extension < 2 cm ) horizons are neglected.

Explanation of soil temperature regimes1
The temperature of a soil is one of its important properties. Within limits, temperature controls the possibilities for plant growth and for soil formation. Below freezing point, there is no biotic activity, water no longer moves as a liquid, and, unless there is frost heaving, time stands still for the soil. Between 0 and 5 °C, root growth of most plant species and germination of most seeds are impossible. A horizon as cold as 5 °C is a thermal pan to the roots of most plants. Each pedon has a characteristic temperature regime that can be measured and described. For most practical purposes, the temperature regime can be described by: the mean annual soil temperature; the average seasonal fluctuations from that mean; and the mean warm or cold seasonal temperature gradient within the main rootzone, which is the zone from a depth of 5 to 100 cm. MEAN ANNUAL SOIL TEMPERATURE Each pedon has a mean annual temperature that is essentially the same in all horizons at all depths in the soil and at depths considerably below the soil. The measured mean annual soil temperature is seldom the same in successive depths at a given location. However, the differences are so small that it seems valid and useful to take a single value as the mean annual temperature of a soil. The mean annual soil temperature is related most closely to the mean annual air temperature, but this relationship is affected to some extent by: the amount and distribution of rain; the amount of snow; the protection provided by shade and by O horizons in forests; the slope aspect and gradient; and irrigation. Other factors, such as soil colour, texture, and content of organic matter, have negligible effects. FLUCTUATIONS IN SOIL TEMPERATURE The mean annual temperature of a soil is not a single reading but the average of a series of readings. Near the surface, the readings may fluctuate from the mean fully as much as those of the air temperature, especially where there is no insulating cover. The fluctuations occur as daily and annual cycles, which weather events make somewhat irregular in most places.

in a zone where the temperature is constant and is the same as the mean annual soil temperature. ESTIMATION OF SOIL TEMPERATURE Soil temperature can often be estimated from climatological data with a precision that is adequate for the present needs of soil surveys. Where it is not possible to make reasonably precise estimates, the measurement of soil temperature need not be a difficult or a time-consuming task. Frequently, the mean annual soil temperature for much of the United States of America is estimated by adding 1 °C to the mean annual air temperature. The mean summer soil temperature at a specific depth can also be estimated. To make this estimate, it is possible to take the average summer temperatures of the upper 100 cm and correct for the temperature-depth gradient by adding or subtracting 0.6 °C for each 10 cm above or below a depth of 50 cm. The mean winter temperature of many mid-latitude soils can be estimated from the difference between the mean annual temperatures and the mean summer temperatures because the differences are of the same magnitude but have opposite signs. CLASSES OF SOIL TEMPERATURE REGIMES The following is a description of the soil temperature regimes used in defining classes at various categoric levels in the soil taxonomy of the United States of America. PG ­ Pergelic (Latin per, throughout in time and space, and gelare, to freeze; meaning permanent frost). Soils with a pergelic temperature regime have a mean annual temperature lower than 0 °C. These are soils that have permafrost if they are moist, or dry frost if there is no excess water. CR ­ Cryic (Greek kryos, coldness; meaning very cold soils). Soils in this temperature regime have a mean annual temperature lower than 8 °C but do not have permafrost. 1. In mineral soils, the mean summer soil temperature (June, July and August in the Northern Hemisphere, and December, January, and February in the Southern Hemisphere) either at a depth of 50 cm from the soil surface or at a densic, lithic or paralithic contact, whichever is shallower, is as follows: a. if the soil is not saturated with water during some part of the summer and: (1) If there is no O horizon: lower than 15 °C; or (2) If there is an O horizon: lower than 8 °C; or b. if the soil is saturated with water during some part of the summer and: (1) If there is no O horizon: lower than 13 °C; or (2) If there is an O horizon or a histic epipedon: lower than 6 °C. 2. In organic soils, the mean annual soil temperature is lower than 6 °C. Cryic soils that have an aquic moisture regime are commonly churned by frost.

Isofrigid soils could also have a cryic temperature regime. A few with organic materials in the upper part are exceptions. The concepts of the soil temperature regimes described below are used in defining classes of soils in the low categories. FR ­ Frigid A soil with a frigid temperature regime is warmer in summer than a soil with a cryic regime. However, its mean annual temperature is lower than 8 °C and the difference between mean summer (June, July and August) and mean winter (December, January and February) soil temperatures is more than 6 °C either at a depth of 50 cm from the soil surface or at a densic, lithic or paralithic contact, whichever is shallower. IF ­ Isofrigid The mean annual soil temperature is lower than 8 °C and the mean summer and mean winter soil temperatures differ by less than 6 °C at a depth of 50 cm or at a densic, lithic or paralithic contact, whichever is shallower. ME ­ Mesic The mean annual soil temperature is 8 °C or higher but lower than 15 °C, and the difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperatures is more than 6 °C either at a depth of 50 cm from the soil surface or at a densic, lithic or paralithic contact, whichever is shallower. IM ­ Isomesic The mean annual soil temperature is 8 °C or higher but lower than 15 °C and the mean summer and mean winter soil temperatures differ by less than 6 °C at a depth of 50 cm or at a densic, lithic or paralithic contact, whichever is shallower. TH ­ Thermic The mean annual soil temperature is 15 °C or higher but lower than 22 °C, and the difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperatures is more than 6 °C either at a depth of 50 cm from the soil surface or at a densic, lithic or paralithic contact, whichever is shallower. IT ­ Isothermic The mean annual soil temperature is 15 °C or higher but lower than 22 °C and the mean summer and mean winter soil temperatures differ by less than 6 °C at a depth of 50 cm or at a densic, lithic or paralithic contact, whichever is shallower. HT ­ Hyperthermic The mean annual soil temperature is 22 °C or higher, and the difference between mean summer and mean winter soil temperatures is more than 6 °C at a depth of

50 cm from the soil surface or at a densic, lithic or paralithic contact, whichever is shallower. IH ­ Isohyperthermic The mean annual soil temperature is 22 °C or higher and the mean summer and mean winter soil temperatures differ by less than 6 °C at a depth of 50 cm or at a densic, lithic or paralithic contact, whichever is shallower.

Explanation of soil moisture regimes1
The term "soil moisture regime" refers to the presence or absence either of groundwater or of water held at a tension of less than 1 500 kPa (pF 4.2) in the soil or in specific horizons during periods of the year. Water held at a tension of 1 500 kPa or more is not available to keep most mesophytic plants alive. The availability of water is also affected by dissolved salts. Where a soil is saturated with water that is too salty to be available to most plants, it is considered salty rather than dry. Consequently, a horizon is considered dry when the moisture tension is 1 500 kPa or more, and it is considered moist when water is held at a tension of less than 1 500 kPa but more than zero. A soil may be continuously moist in some or all horizons either throughout the year or for some part of the year. It may be either moist in winter and dry in summer or the reverse. In the Northern Hemisphere, summer refers to June, July and August, and winter refers to December, January and February. SIGNIFICANCE TO SOIL CLASSIFICATION The moisture regime of a soil is an important property of the soil as well as a determinant of processes that can occur in the soil. During geological time, there have been significant changes in climate. Soils that could have formed only in a humid climate are now preserved in an arid climate in some areas. Such soils have relict features that reflect the former moisture regime and other features that reflect the present moisture regime. Each of the moisture regimes in the history of a soil is a factor in the genesis of that soil and is the cause of many accessory characteristics. However, most of the accessory characteristics and those most important for interpretations are associated with the present moisture regime, even if the present regime differs widely from some of the earlier. More importantly, the present climate determines use and management of the soil. It is a property of the soil. Furthermore, the moisture regimes of most soils are inferred from the present climate, and small-scale maps can be interpreted in terms of the many accessory characteristics that are common to most of the soils that have a common climate. These characteristics include: the amount, nature and distribution of organic matter; the base status of the soil; and the presence or absence of salts.

NORMAL YEARS In the discussions that follow and throughout the keys, the term "normal years" is used. A normal year is defined as a year that has plus or minus one standard deviation of the long-term mean annual precipitation (long term refers to 30 years or more). In addition, the mean monthly precipitation in a normal year must be plus or minus one standard deviation of the long-term monthly precipitation for 8 of the 12 months. Normal years can usually be calculated from the mean annual precipitation. However, when catastrophic events occur during a year, the standard deviations of the monthly means should also be calculated. ESTIMATION The landscape position of every soil is subject to extremes in climate. While no two years have exactly the same weather conditions, the moisture status of the soil must be characterized by probability. Weather probabilities can be determined from long-term weather records and observations of how each soil responds to weather conditions as modified by its landscape position. A number of methods have been devised to relate soil moisture to meteorological records. To date, all these methods have some shortcomings, even for gently sloping soils that depend primarily on precipitation for their moisture. Dew and fog can add appreciable amounts of moisture to some soils, but quantitative data are rare. SOIL MOISTURE CONTROL SECTION The intention in defining the soil moisture control section is to facilitate estimation of soil moisture regimes from climate data. The upper boundary of this control section is the depth to which a dry (tension of more than 1 500 kPa, but not air-dry) soil will be moistened by 2.5 cm of water within 24 hours. The lower boundary is the depth to which a dry soil will be moistened by 7.5 cm of water within 48 hours. These depths do not include the depth of moistening along any cracks or animal burrows that are open to the surface. The boundaries for the soil moisture control section correspond to the rooting depths for many crops. However, there are natural plant communities that have their roots either above or below the control section. Attempts are currently being made to improve the parameters of the soil moisture control section. If 7.5 cm of water moistens the soil to a densic, lithic, paralithic or petroferric contact or to a petrocalcic or petrogypsic horizon or a duripan, the contact or the upper boundary of the cemented horizon constitutes the lower boundary of the soil moisture control section. The concept of the soil moisture control section does not apply well to the cracking clays, because these clays remoisten from both the surface and the bases of the cracks. The soil moisture patterns of these soils are defined in terms of the pattern of cracking over time. If moistening occurs unevenly, the weighted average depth of moistening in a pedon is used for the limits of the moisture control section.

The moisture control section of a soil extends approximately: from 10 to 30 cm below the soil surface if the particle-size class of the soil is fine-loamy (> 15 percent particles 0.1­75 mm and 18­35 percent clay), coarse-silty (< 15 percent particles 0.1­75 mm and < 18 percent clay in fine earth), fine-silty (< 15 percent particles 0.1­75 mm and 18­35 percent clay in fine earth), or clayey (> 35 percent clay); from 20 to 60 cm if the particle-size class is coarse-loamy silty (>15 percent particles 0.1­75 mm and < 18 percent clay in fine earth); from 30 to 90 cm if the particle-size class is sandy (texture of sand or loamy sand). If the soil contains rock and pararock fragments that do not absorb and release water, the limits of the moisture control section are deeper. The limits of the soil moisture control section are affected not only by the particle-size class but also by differences in soil structure or pore-size distribution or by other factors that influence the movement and retention of water in the soil. CLASSES OF SOIL MOISTURE REGIMES The soil moisture regimes are defined in terms of the level of groundwater and in terms of the seasonal presence or absence of water held at a tension of less than 1 500 kPa in the moisture control section. It is assumed in the definitions that the soil supports whatever vegetation it is capable of supporting, i.e., crops, grass or native vegetation, and that the amount of stored moisture is not being increased by irrigation or fallowing. These cultural practices affect the soil moisture conditions as long as they continued. AQ ­ Aquic moisture regime The aquic (Latin aqua, water) moisture regime is a reducing regime in a soil that is virtually free of dissolved oxygen because it is saturated by water. Some soils are saturated with water at times while dissolved oxygen is present, either because the water is moving or because the environment is unfavourable for micro-organisms (e.g. where the temperature is less than 1 °C); such a regime is not considered aquic. It is not known how long a soil must be saturated before it is said to have an aquic moisture regime. However, the duration must be at least a few days, because it is implicit in the concept that dissolved oxygen is virtually absent. PQ ­ Peraquic moisture regime Very commonly, the level of groundwater fluctuates with the seasons. However, there are soils in which the groundwater is always at or very close to the surface. Examples are soils in tidal marshes or in closed, landlocked depressions fed by perennial streams. Such soils are considered to have a peraquic moisture regime.

AR ­ Aridic and TO ­ torric (Latin aridus, dry, and torridus, hot and dry) moisture regimes These terms are used for the same moisture regime but in different categories of the taxonomy. In the aridic (torric) moisture regime, the moisture control section in normal years is both: dry in all parts for more than half on the cumulative days per year when the soil temperature at a depth of 50 cm from the soil surface is above 5 °C; moist in some or all parts for less than 90 consecutive days when the soil temperature at a depth of 50 cm is above 8 °C. Soils that have an aridic (torric) moisture regime normally occur in areas of arid climates. A few are in areas of semi-arid climates and either have physical properties that keep them dry, such as a crusty surface that virtually precludes the infiltration of water, or are on steep slopes where runoff is high. There is little or no leaching in this moisture regime, and soluble salts accumulate in the soils if there is a source. UD ­ Udic moisture regime The udic (Latin udus, humid) moisture regime is one in which the soil moisture control section is not dry in any part for as long as 90 cumulative days in normal years. Where the mean annual soil temperature is lower than 22 °C and where the mean winter and mean summer soil temperatures at depth of 50 cm from the soil surface differ by 6 °C or more, the soil moisture control section in normal years is dry in all parts for less than 45 consecutive in the 4 months following the summer solstice. In addition, the udic moisture regime requires, except for short periods, a three-phase system, solid­liquid­gas, in part or all of the soil moisture control section when the soil temperature is above 5 °C. The udic moisture regime is common to the soils of humid climates that: have well-distributed rainfall; have enough rain in summer so that the amount of stored moisture plus rainfall is approximately equal to, or exceeds, the amount of evapotranspiration; or have adequate winter rains to recharge the soils and cool, foggy summers, as in coastal areas. Water moves downwards though the soils at some time in normal years. PU ­ Perudic moisture regime (Latin per, throughout in time, and udus, humid) In climates where precipitation exceeds evapotranspiration in all months of normal years, the moisture tension rarely reaches 100 kPa (pF 3) in the soil moisture control section, although there are occasional brief periods when some stored moisture is used. The water moves through the soil in all months when it is not frozen. Such an extremely wet moisture regime is called perudic. US ­ Ustic moisture regime The ustic (Latin ustus, burnt; implying dryness) moisture regime is intermediate between the aridic regime and the udic regime. Its concept is one of moisture

that is limited but is present at a time when conditions are suitable for plant growth. The concept of the ustic moisture regime is not applied to soils that have permafrost or a cryic soil temperature regime (defined above). If the mean annual soil temperature is 22 °C or higher or if the mean summer and winter soil temperatures differ by less than 6 °C at a depth of 50 cm below the soil surface, the soil moisture control section in areas of the ustic moisture regime is dry in some or all parts for 90 or more cumulative days in normal years. However, it is moist in some part either for more than 180 cumulative days per year or for 90 or more consecutive days. If the mean annual soil temperature is lower than 22 °C and if the mean summer and winter soil temperatures differ by 6 °C or more at a depth of 50 cm from the soil surface, the soil moisture control section in areas of the ustic moisture regime is dry in some or all parts for 90 or more cumulative days in normal years, but it is not dry in all parts for more than half of the cumulative days when the soil temperature at a depth of 50 cm is higher than 5 °C. If in normal years the moisture control section is moist in all parts for 45 or more consecutive days in the 4 months following the winter solstice, the moisture control section is dry in all parts for less than 45 consecutive days in the 4 months following the summer solstice. In tropical and subtropical regions that have a monsoon climate with either one or two dry seasons, summer and winter seasons have little meaning. In such regions, the moisture regime is ustic if there is at least one rainy season of three months or more. In temperate regions of subhumid or semi-arid climates, the rainy seasons are usually spring and summer or spring and autumn, but never winter. Native plants are mainly annuals or plants that have a dormant period while the soil is dry. XE ­ Xeric moisture regime The xeric (Greek xeros, dry) moisture regime is the typical moisture regime in areas of Mediterranean climates, where winters are moist and cool and summers are warm and dry. The moisture, which falls during the winter, when potential evapotranspiration is at a minimum, is particularly effective for leaching. In areas of a xeric moisture regime, the soil moisture control section, in normal years, is dry in all parts for 45 or more consecutive days in the 4 months following the summer solstice and moist in all parts for 45 or more consecutive days in the 4 months following the winter solstice. Moreover, in normal years, the moisture control section is moist in some part for more than half of the cumulative days per year when the soil temperature at a depth of 50 cm from the soil surface is higher than 6 °C or for 90 or more consecutive days when the soil temperature at a depth of 50 cm is higher than 8 °C. The mean annual soil temperature is lower than 22 °C, and the mean summer and mean winter soil temperatures differ by 6 °C or more either at a depth of 50 cm from the soil surface or at a densic, lithic or paralithic contact if shallower.
