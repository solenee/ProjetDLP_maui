FOREWORD

This document is the twenty-second issue of the publication Selected indicators of food and agriculture development in Asia-Pacific region. It presents data on selected items for t h e years 1994­2004, except some tables that provide information for the period 1993­2003. Most tables show two types of information: annual figures for 1994, 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004 and the exponential growth rate for the period 1994­2004. The indicators are grouped under the following headings: Agricultural land and population, Agricultural inputs, Production indices, Staple food crops, Edible oil crops, Horticultural crops, Fibre crops, Other crops, Livestock, Agricultural trade, Fisheries, Forestry, Nutrition and Other indicators including a table reporting the status of organic farming in the region. A section on country profiles precedes the tables. Countries of the region are shown under two groups: "Developing countries/transition economies" and "Developed countries". For comparison purposes, figures relating to "Rest of world" and "World" are also presented. Data for member countries in the region have been included in this year's publication. Please note that country data for Timor-Leste were reported as provincial data for Indonesia before 2000 and no country data were reported for the Federal States of Micronesia before 1995. Other sources of data are cited. For almost all commodity tables, data are retrieved from the FAO computerized data base, especially FAOSTAT, or from the FAO Yearbooks. Some data items have not been updated during the conversion to the new FAOSTAT. These data are based on information supplied by member countries. The growth rates shown in the present publication have been worked out using the exponential growth method to indicate the overall regional performance and also to highlight intercountry differences. Various units of FAO including the Statistics Division and the Information Systems and Technology Division have cooperated with the FAO Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific in the preparation of this publication, providing computer programs and data bases for the production of tables. This collaboration is duly acknowledged.

The Philippines is one of the world's largest archipelagos; with more than 7 100 islands, it extends 1 900 km north to south and 1 100 km east to west. The land is mostly mountainous with coastal lowlands. The Philippines has extensive fishing resources (both marine and inland) and large deposits of mineral and energy resources, such as petroleum, nickel, cobalt, silver and gold, and timber. Reflecting its varied resource endowments, physical and human, the economy is diversified. Rice and coconut production continue to dominate the agricultural sector. Other main agricultural commodities include corn, sugarcane, bananas, pineapples and mangoes. About 38 percent of the workforce engages in agriculture. The share of agriculture in total GDP has declined as the sector contributed only about 14.7 percent of the total GDP in 2002. Reflecting this trend, agricultural exports currently account for less than 5 percent of the country's foreign earnings. Agricultural imports have grown at an annual rate of 4.6 percent from 1993 to 2003. Wheat is the main agricultural import, followed by cigarettes, soybeans (including the cake of soya beans) and rice. Over the same period, agricultural exports have grown at 0.4 percent.

Thailand consists of a densely populated central plain; northeastern plateau; mountain range in the west; and a southern isthmus that connects to Malaysia. Natural resources are tin, rubber, natural gas, tungsten, tantalum, timber, lead, fish, gypsum, lignite and fluorite. The Thai economy is export-dependent, with exports accounting for 60 percent of GDP. The agriculture sector accounted for 9.4 percent of GDP in 2002. Approximately 55 percent of Thailand's labor force is employed in agriculture. Rice, the dominant agricultural export crop, is irrigated in the Central Plains and in the basins of northern Thailand, but it is rain-fed elsewhere. Thailand remains the world's largest exporter of rice, and in 2003 sold 7.3 million tonnes (down from 7.7 million tonnes in 2001) worth US$1.9 billion. Other agricultural products are tapioca, rubber, corn, sugarcane, coconuts and soybeans. Other agricultural commodities produced in significant amounts include fish and fishery products. Agricultural imports have grown at an annual rate of 2.6 percent from 1993 to 2003. Cotton lint is the main agricultural import, followed by soybeans (including the cake of soya beans), cattle hides and wheat. Over the same period, agricultural exports have grown at an annual rate of 1.8 percent. Natural rubber and paddy rice are the country's two major agricultural export items. The country also exports chicken meats and canned chicken, and raw and refined sugar.

Timor­Leste is a small mountainous country that is classified among the poorest countries of the world and the poorest in Southeast Asia. The agricultural sector contributes about 25 percent to GDP. Approximately 40 percent of the population of 864 000 is considered to be below the national poverty line of 1.5 US$ per day. GDP is expected to decline further, reflecting the continued effect of the reduced international presence and the adverse impact of a delayed rainy season on agricultural output. The agricultural economy is dominated by low input/output subsistence agriculture. Important products are maize, cassava, cowpeas, sweet potatoes and rice. Cereal import requirements for the marketing year 2003/04 are estimated at 62 000 tonnes. Household food security is highly heterogeneous across districts and the country, although food insecurity is generally a more pronounced problem in rural upland areas. Main agricultural imports include paddy rice, vegetables and prepared food. Coffee is the major agricultural export followed by copra, spices and coco beans.

The terrain of Viet Nam varies from mountainous to coastal delta. Natural resources are coal, crude oil, zinc, copper, silver, gold, manganese and iron. Main agricultural products are rice, maize, sweet potato, peanut, soya bean, cotton, coffee and cashews. Measured by employment, Viet Nam is an agrarian society, with around 67 percent of the labour force working in agriculture. Since 1986, when the Sixth Party Congress approved a broad economic reform package called "Doi Moi" (renovation), Viet Nam became one of the fastest growing economies in the world, averaging around 8 percent annual GDP growth from 1990 to 1997. Simultaneously, agricultural production doubled, transforming Viet Nam from a net food importer to one of the world's largest exporters of rice and of commodities such as coffee, tea, rubber, pepper and fisheries products. However, agriculture's share of economic output declined, falling from 42 percent in 1989 to 23.0 percent in 2002 (as production in other sectors of the economy increased). Agricultural imports have grown at an annual rate of 12.6 percent from 1993 to 2003. Main agricultural imports include soya bean cake, cigarettes and wheat. Over the same period, agricultural exports have increased 7.4 percent annually. Paddy rice is the major agricultural export followed by coffee, natural rubber, cashew nuts, pepper and tea.

Afghanistan is a country of rugged mountains and arid plains, which become deserts in the southwest. It has a wealth of natural resources, including extensive deposits of natural gas, petroleum, coal, copper, chromites, talc, barites, sulfur, lead, zinc, iron ore, salt, and precious and semiprecious stones. Agricultural production is constrained by an almost total dependence on erratic winter snows and spring rains for water; irrigation is primitive. The main agriculture products are wheat, corn, barley, rice, cotton, fruit, nuts, karakul pelts, wool and mutton. The economy has traditionally been dominated by agriculture, which accounted for 52 percent of the GDP and employed around 66 percent of the workforce in 2002. Relatively little use is made of machines, chemical fertilizers or pesticides. Years of fighting left former cultivated lands uncultivated and yields have almost dropped by 35 percent leading to persistent food shortages and an increase of food imports. Four consecutive recent years of drought brought a food crisis to Afghanistan. Official statistics have been nonexistent since the fall of the government in 1992. One of the largest sectors of the economy is opium poppy cultivation and processing. According to UNDCP, in the 2002 crop year Afghanistan accounted for threequarters of the world's heroine production.

The land of Bangladesh is mostly flat, although there are some hilly areas in the northeastern and southeastern regions. Much of the land is intersected by the numerous waterways of the Ganges Delta and the Brahmaputra River. The annual flooding of the land provides rich alluvial soils. Natural resources are natural gas, fertile soil and water. Around 75 percent of the planted crop area is devoted to rice crops. Main agriculture products are rice, jute, tea, sugar and wheat. Because of Bangladesh's fertile soil and normally ample water supply, rice can be grown and harvested three times a year in many areas. Bangladesh's predominantly agricultural economy accounted for 22.7 percent of the total GDP in 2002, depending heavily on an erratic monsoonal cycle with periodic flooding and drought. Most Bangladeshis, 54 percent of the total workforce, earn their living from agriculture. Population pressure continues to place a severe burden on productive capacity, creating a food deficit, especially of wheat. Foreign assistance and commercial imports fill the gap. Agricultural imports have grown at an annual rate of 9.9 percent from 1993 to 2003. Main agricultural imports include wheat, paddy rice, cotton lint, palm oil and soya bean oil. Over the same period, agricultural exports have decreased 2.3 percent annually. Jute is the country's major agricultural export followed by fresh vegetables, tea, tobacco leaves and nuts.

Bhutan, one of the world's smallest and least developed countries, is mostly mountainous with some fertile valleys and savanna; 66 percent of the total land is forest. Natural resources are timber, hydropower, gypsum and calcium carbide. The economy is closely aligned with India through strong trade and monetary links and dependence on India's financial assistance. Although poor in terms of income per head, poverty is less evident than in most countries of similar income levels. The economy of Bhutan is based on agriculture and forestry, providing the main livelihood to almost 94 percent of the workforce and contributing 33.9 percent of GDP in 2002. Bhutan is largely an agrarian society; agriculture consists mainly of subsistence farming and animal husbandry. However, the main growth in the sector is a result of forestry and cash-crop production. Increasing self-sufficiency is a major target of the government. Main agricultural products are rice, corn, root crops, citrus, milk and eggs. Agricultural imports have grown at an annual rate of 1.3 percent from 1993 to 2003. Main agricultural imports include paddy rice, barley beer and mustard seed oil. Over the same period, agricultural exports have increased 0.1 percent annually. Beverages are the country's major agricultural export followed by wheat flour, oranges, apples and potatoes.

The terrain of India varies from the Himalayas to flat river valleys. Natural resources are coal, iron ore, manganese, mica, bauxite, chromite, thorium, limestone, barite, titanium ore, diamonds and crude oil. Twothirds of India's labour force works in agriculture which, with forestry and fishing, accounts for around 22.7 percent of GDP. However, the majority of landholdings are farmed at subsistence level, and many farming families live below the poverty line. India has some of the lowest human development indicators in the world, particularly in rural areas. At the other end of the scale, India also has a large number of highly qualified professionals, as well as several internationally established industrial groups. Main agriculture products are wheat, rice, coarse grains, oilseeds, sugar, cotton, jute and tea. With the introduction of high-yield crop varieties and new fertilizing and irrigation techniques, the so-called Green Revolution, India has been self-sufficient in food since the mid-1970s. Agricultural imports have grown at an annual rate of 12.3 percent from 1993 to 2003. Main agricultural imports include palm oil, soya bean oil, cotton lint, cashew nuts and pulses. Over the same period, agricultural exports have increased 4.4 percent annually. Paddy rice is the major agricultural export followed by wheat, cashew nuts and tea.

The terrain of Iran mostly consists of desert and mountains. Natural resources are petroleum, natural gas and some mineral deposits. Main agriculture products are wheat, rice, other grains, sugar beets, fruits, nuts, cotton, dairy products, wool and caviar. Historically an agricultural society, Iran achieved significant industrialization and economic modernization by the 1970s, but the pace of growth slowed dramatically until after the end of the war with Iraq. The oil sector's share of GDP declined from 30-40 percent in the 1970s to 10-20 percent, mainly as a result of war damage to production facilities; oil revenue still provides some 80 percent of export earnings. State investment, large-scale irrigation schemes and wider production of export-based agricultural items such as dates, flowers and pistachios made agriculture Iran's fastest growing sector over much of the 1990s. Production was reduced significantly by severe drought from 1999-2001, leading to heavy losses in livestock and cereal production. After a strong recovery Iran appears within reach of food self-sufficiency. Agriculture remains one of the largest employers, accounting for about 26 percent of all jobs and 12 percent of GDP. Agricultural imports have decreased at an annual rate of 0.5 percent from 1993 to 2003. Soya bean oil is the main agricultural import, followed by maize, paddy rice, cigarettes and wheat. Over the same period, agricultural exports have increased at 2.8 percent annually. Pistachios, raisins, spices and tomato paste are the main agricultural exports.

The 1 190 islands of the Maldives are scattered over a vast area of the Indian Ocean (90 000 square kilometres), complicating transport, especially in rough seas, and making service delivery to the unevenly distributed and widely dispersed population living on 198 islands very expensive. Marine resources are the main natural endowment, with economic activities concentrated on fishing and tourism. There are no inland fisheries and no aquaculture in the Maldives. Fishing operations take place in off-shore, coastal and reef waters. Currently fisheries account for 11 percent of GDP, 20 percent of employment and 74 percent of the country's export commodities. A small internal market (many island communities depend on a single source of income (fishing)), scarcity of jobs and very limited agricultural opportunities add to the complexity of development challenges. Agricultural imports have grown at an annual rate of 6.4 percent from 1993 to 2003. Main agricultural imports include cigarettes, dry whole milk, wheat flour and paddy rice. Over the same period, agricultural exports have decreased 10.7 percent annually. Fish meal is the major agricultural export followed by fish oils.

The size of the annual cotton crop, the bulk of it grown in Punjab province, is a crucial barometer of the health of the overall economy since it accounts for 80 percent of export earnings. Natural resources are arable land, natural gas, limited petroleum, substantial hydropower potential, coal and iron ore. Main agriculture products are wheat, cotton, rice, sugarcane and tobacco. In 2002, agriculture accounted for 23.2 percent of GDP and provided employment to 46 percent of the labour force. It supplies most of the country's food, but is also the source of raw materials for major domestic industries, especially for cotton products. Two fundamental problems that trouble the agricultural sector are: an excessive dependence on a cotton crop highly susceptible to adverse weather conditions and pest damage; and the food import bill, which is rising rapidly despite a steady increase in crop, livestock and fruit production. Agricultural imports decreased at an annual rate of 0.9 percent from 1993 to 2003. Main imported agricultural commodities include palm oil, cotton lint, tea and rapeseed. Over the same period, agricultural exports have grown at 2.8 percent annually. Paddy rice is the main export followed by wheat, cotton lint and molasses.

The terrain of Sri Lanka consists of coastal plains in the northern third of the country, with hills and mountains in south-central Sri Lanka which rise as high as 2 133 meters. Natural resources are limestone, graphite, mineral sands, gems and phosphate. Sri Lanka's economy is highly dependent on domestic trade. The main agriculture products are rice, tea, rubber, coconut and spices. The plantation sector produces the three main export crops ­ tea, rubber and coconut ­ of which only tea has the potential for any real increase in output. Sri Lanka is the world's leading tea exporter, and second only to the Philippines in the export of desiccated coconut and natural rubber. Paddy rice dominates the non-plantation agricultural sector and accounts for one-fifth of total agricultural output, rendering it an important determinant of agricultural growth. Although yields have improved continuously, high production costs are a drawback. Agriculture has lost its relative importance to the Sri Lankan economy in recent decades. It accounts for 20.1 percent of GDP and provides employment to 45 percent of the working population. Agricultural imports have grown at an annual rate of 5.1 percent from 1993 to 2003. Main imported agricultural commodities include wheat, dry whole milk, sugar, palm oil and soya bean cake. Over the same period, agricultural exports have grown at 8.4 percent annually. Tea is the main export followed by cinnamon, natural rubber and tobacco leaves.
