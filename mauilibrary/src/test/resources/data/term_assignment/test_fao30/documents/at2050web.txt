CHAPTER

Overview

1.1 Why the new outlook to 2050
Thisisanupdatedversion,withextensionofprojections to2050,oftwoofthekeychapters(Chapters2and3)of thestudyWorld Agriculture: Towards 2015/30completed in 2002 and published in 2003 (Bruinsma, 2003). Chapter 2 presents prospective developments in food demand and consumption and possible implications for nutrition and undernourishment. Chapter 3 deals with production,consumptionandtrade,intermsofthemain commoditysectorsandaggregateagriculture. This updating and extension is undertaken for a number of reasons, in addition to the need to take on board more recent data and historical ones that have beenrevised. The first has to do with demography. Future world population may be lower than the projections available atthetimeoftheearlierstudyindicated.Forthisreason, food requirements in the future may be lower than projected in the earlier study. In addition, longer-term projections suggest that the end of world population growthmaybewithinsightbythemiddleofthiscentury, as world population may peak at 9.2 billion around the year 20751. In practice, much of the increase between the 6.1 billion of 2000 and the peak will have occurred by2050whenworldpopulationmayreach8.9billion.It

followsthatoverthenext50yearsworldagriculturemay be transiting to a future when global population growth will no longer be the major driving force for further growth in world food demand and production. This has consequences for the rate at which further pressures on landandwaterresourcesandthewiderenvironmentwill bebuildingup. In this context, of particular interest is the question: will the eventual cessation of world population growth imply that the classical Malthusian concerns (the prospect that population growth will run ahead of the potential of agriculture to increase food production, and its corollary ­ food insecurity attributed predominantly toproductionconstraints),willnolongerberelevant?We attempttoestimatethemagnitudesinvolved,buttheshort answer is that these concerns will probably retain their fullrelevancewellbeyond2050,asexplainedinSection 1.2 below. The second reason is that the growing tightness of energy markets and associated rising oil prices may exert some important effects on food and agriculture that have to be taken into account. At the time of the earlier projections, the World Bank's price outlook for oil was that it could decline from the US$ 28/barrel of 2000 to US$ 21/barrel in 2015 in current dollars and even more in constant dollars of 19902. The outlook is

quitedifferentintheBank'slatestassessmentinviewof the recent sharp price rises ­ to a 2005 average of US$ 53.4/barrel. Thus, "the World Bank has adopted a technical assumption for the future path of oil prices based on a slow decline toward US$ 40 per barrel by 2010"3. High energy prices affect the food and agriculture sector in several ways. Besides the classical ones (via macroeconomic effects affecting all aspects of production, consumption and trade, and the more direct onesonproductionagricultureviatheeffectsonthecosts of the energy-intensive inputs like fertilizer and fuel) they can impact agriculture by creating new markets for thoseproductswhichcanbeusedasbiomassfeedstocks for the production of biofuels as substitutes for the petroleum-based fuels (petrol, diesel) in transport4.

The renewable fuel provisions in the Energy PolicyAct of 2005 will further promote such use: by 2015, it may become more important than exports and could account forsome23percentofthecountry'smaizeoutput5,with importantimpactsonworldmarkets. Again with subsidies, the use of vegetable oils to produce biodiesel is expanding in certain EU countries, whiletheEUhasatargetofa5.75percentmarketshareof biofuelsinthepetrolanddieselmarketin2010.Thelatest projections of the European Commission foresee that 1.5milliontonnes6ofgrainandsome10milliontonnesof oilseedsmaybeusedtoproducebioenergyin2012.There is growing interest in the countries with abundant, or potentiallyso,productionpotentialofsuitablefeedstocks (like palm oil for biodiesel in Malaysia and Indonesia, cassavaandsugarcaneforethanolinThailand)forgoing the way of producing biofuels, both for domestic use andexport.

Althoughatpresentthepromotionofbiofuelsisoften usedinseveralindustrializedcountriesasameanstorelax the demand constraints facing agriculture, in the future it can have far-reaching effects on world agriculture as it can offer novel development opportunities for countries with significant agricultural resources, if barriers to trade of biofuels were eased or removed. Africa, with its significant sugar cane production potential,isoftencitedasaregionthatcouldprofitfrom Brazil's experience and technology7, though obstacles to realizing it (infrastructure, institutional, etc.) should not be underestimated. Eventually, the competitiveness of biofuels may be further enhanced if the savings of greenhouse gas emissions resulting from substituting ethanolforgasolineweretobemonetizedintheformof tradable carbon credits (Certified Emission Reductions of greenhouse gases) through the Clean Development MechanismundertheprovisionsoftheKyotoProtocol. Itistooearlytodealfullywiththisimportantsubject, giventheuncertaintiesaboutfutureoilprices.However, the issue of alternative energy sources is very alive and questions are increasingly asked about the potential of world agriculture to become a significant source of feedstocks and in particular the food security and environmental implications, e.g. further  deforestation fromtheeventualexpansionoflandunderthefeedstock crops (oil palm, soybeans, sugar cane, etc). Our conventionalprojectionsto2050areafirstandnecessary stepinaddressingthisissue:theycanhelpestablishhow much more food and related agricultural resources the world may need and in which countries ­ a valuable input into any evaluation of the potential for diverting agricultural resources to other uses and what this may implyforfoodsecurity.Theadvancementoftechnology inconvertinglignocellulosicbiomass(fromcropresidues, grasses and wood) to produce "cellulosic" ethanol may contribute to mitigating eventual pressures on the land withfoodcropproductionpotential.

Overview

and the prospects that the target will be attained are not encouraging. The significant progress made by some countriesisbeingcompensatedbyseveresetbackssuffered by other countries.The latter tend to be those with high population growth rates, hence failures to increase food consumption per capita are translated into increases of thenumbersundernourished.Forthoseamongthemwith pooragriculturalresourcesandhighdependenceonthem fortheirfoodsecurityandoveralldevelopment,thetask ofachievingintheforeseeablefuturethequantumjumps infoodconsumptionrequiredformeetingthetargetmay proveveryarduousindeed.Longertermprojectionscan help drive home the issue that even if the global target forreducingundernutritionwereachieved,therewillstill be several countries with unacceptably high incidence. The need to plan ahead interventions to cope with the persistence of high undernutrition will likely remain a liveissueformanyyearstocome.

In conclusion, zero population growth at the global level will not automatically translate into zero growth in demand and cessation of the building-up of pressures on resources and the wider environment. The need for production to keep growing in several countries will continue to condition their prospects for improved nutrition. In those among them that have limitedagriculturalpotential,theproblemofproductionconstrained food insecurity and significant incidence of undernourishment may persist, even in a world with stationary population and plentiful food supplies (or potential to increase production) at the global level. Nothing new here: this situation prevails at present and it will not go away simply because population stops growing at the global level. Projections to 2050 provide abasisforthinkingaboutthispossibleoutcome.

Food and nutrition
Thehistoricaltrendtowardsincreasedfoodconsumption per capita as a world average and particularly in the developing countries will likely continue, but at slower ratesthaninthepastasmoreandmorecountriesapproach medium-high levels. The average of the developing countries, that rose from 2110 kcal/person/day 30 years agotothepresent2650kcal,mayrisefurtherto2960kcal inthenext30yearsandonto3070kcalby2050.Bythe middle of the century the great bulk of their population (90 percent) may live in countries with over 2700 kcal, up from 51 percent at present and only 4 percent three decades ago. As in the past, the great improvements in China and a few other populous countries will continue tocarryasignificantweightinthesedevelopments.  However, not all countries may achieve food consumption levels consonant with requirements for good nutrition. This may be the case of some of the countries which start with very low consumption (under 2200 kcal/person/day in 1999/01), high rates of undernourishment, high population growth rates, poor prospects for rapid economic growth and often meagre agricultural resources. There are 32 countries in this category, with rates of undernourishment between 29 percent and 72 percent, an average of 42 percent, YemenandNigeramongthem.Theirpresentpopulation of 580 million is projected to grow to 1.39 billion by 2050, that of Yemen from 18 million to 84 million and

1.2 Main findings
Continued growth of world agriculture even after the end of world population growth
The main reason is that zero population growth at the globallevelwillbethenetresultofcontinuingincreases in some countries (e.g. by some 31 million annually in 2050 in Africa and South and Western Asia together) compensated by declines in others (e.g. by some 10 million annually in China, Japan and Europe together)8. Nearly all the further population increases will be occurringincountriesseveralofwhichevenin2050may still have inadequate food consumption levels, hence significant scope for further increases in demand. The pressures for further increases of food supplies in these countrieswillcontinue.Muchofitwillhavetobemetby growing local production or, as it happened in the past andisstillhappeningcurrently,itmaynotbefullymet­ a typical case of production-constrained food insecurity. The creation of slack in some countries with declining population (e.g. the transition economies, when growth ofaggregatedemandwillhavebeenreducedtoatrickle- .01percentp.a.inthefinaltwodecades2030-50)willnot necessarily be made available to meet the still growing demandincountrieswithrisingpopulation,e.g.demand growthat2.0percentp.a.insub-SaharanAfrica.

8 Other reasons include the likely continuation of changes in the structure of consumption towards more livestock products following growth in incomes and urbanization, particularly in the developing countries.

thatofNigerfrom11millionto53million.Theircurrent average food consumption of 2000 kcal/person/day is actually a little below that of 30 years ago. Despite the dismalhistoricalrecord,thepotentialexistsforseveralof thesecountriestomakegainsbyassigningprioritytothe developmentoflocalfoodproduction,asothercountries have done in the past. Under this fairly optimistic assumption, the average of the group may grow to 2450 kcal in the next 30 years, though this would still not be sufficient for good nutrition in several of them. Hence theconclusionthatreducingundernourishmentmaybea veryslowprocessinthesecountries. Notwithstanding the several countries with poor prospectsformakingsufficientprogress,thedeveloping countriesasawholewouldrecordsignificantreductions in the relative prevalence of undernourishment (percent of population affected). However, these will not be translated into commensurate declines in the numbers undernourishedbecauseofpopulationgrowth.Reduction in the absolute numbers is likely to be a slow process. Numbers could decline from the 810 million in 1999/01 to580millionin2015,to460millionin2030andtojust over290millionby2050.Thismeansthatthenumberof undernourished in developing countries, which stood at 823 million in 1990/92 (the 3-year average used as the basisfordefiningtheWorldFoodSummittarget),isnot likely to be halved by 2015. However, the proportion of the population undernourished could be halved by 2015 ­ from 20.3 percent in 1990/92 to 10.1 percent in 2015 andonto6.9in2030andto3.9by2050.Itisnotedthat the UN Millennium Development Goals (MDG) refer not to halving the numbers undernourished but rather to atargetto"halve,between1990and2015,theproportion of people who suffer from hunger". In this sense, the MDGgoalmaybeachieved. Despite this slow pace of progress in reducing the prevalenceofundernourishment,theprojectionsdoimply considerable overall improvement. In the developing countries the numbers well-fed (i.e. not classified as undernourishedaccordingtothecriteriausedhere)could increase from 3.9 billion in 1999/01 (83 percent of their population) to 5.2 billion in 2015 (90 percent of the population), to 6.2 billion (93 percent) in 2030 and to 7.2billion(96percent)by2050.Thatwouldbenomean achievement. Fewer countries than at present will have highincidenceofundernourishment,noneoftheminthe most populous class. The problem of undernourishment will tend to become smaller in terms of both absolute numbers affected and, even more, in relative terms (proportionofthepopulation),henceitwillbecomemore

tractable through policy interventions, both national andinternational. The progress in raising per capita food consumption to3000+kcal/person/dayinseveraldevelopingcountries is not always an unmixed blessing. The related diet transitions often imply changes towards energy-dense diets high in fat, particularly saturated fat, sugar and salt and low in unrefined carbohydrates. In combination with lifestyle changes, largely associated with rapid urbanization, such transitions, while beneficent in many countries with still inadequate diets, are often accompaniedbyacorrespondingincreaseindiet-related chronic Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs). In many countries undergoing this transition, obesity-related NCDs tend to appear when health problems related to undernutrition of significant parts of their populations arestillwidelyprevalent.Thetwoproblemsco-existand these countries are confronted with a "double burden of malnutrition"resultinginnovelchallengesandstrainsin theirhealthsystems.

Growth of agriculture and main commodity sectors
Aggregate agriculture: World agriculture (aggregate value of production, all food and non-food crop and livestock commodities) has been growing at rates of 2.1-2.3 percent p.a. in the last four decades, with much of the growth originating in the developing countries (3.4-3.8percentp.a.).Thehighgrowthratesofthelatter reflected, among other things, developments in some large countries - foremost among them China. Without China, the rest of the developing countries grew at 2.8-3.0percentp.a.Theyalsoreflectedtherisingshare ofhighvaluecommoditieslikelivestockproductsinthe totalvalueofproduction:intermsofquantities(whether measuredintonnageorcaloriecontent),thegrowthrates havebeenlower(seeBox3.1). The future may see some drastic decline in the growthofaggregateworldproduction,to1.5percentp.a. in the next three decades and on to 0.9 percent p.a. in the subsequent 20 years to 2050.The slowdown reflects the lower population growth and the gradual attainment of medium-high levels of per capita consumption in a growing number of countries. The latter factor restricts the scope for further growth in demand per capita in severalcountrieswhichhadveryhighgrowthinthepast, foremost among them China. In contrast, developing countries that experienced slow growth in the past (and asresultstillhavelowpercapitaconsumption-lessthan

Overview

2700 kcal/person/day) and potential for further growth, should not experience any slowdown but rather some acceleration. Increasingly, world agriculture will have to depend on non-food uses of commodities if growth rates are not to be sharply lower compared with the past. As noted, the biofuels sector may provide some scope,perhapsasignificantone,forrelaxingthedemand constraintsrepresentedbythedecliningratesofincrease inhumanconsumption. Cereals: All the major commodity sectors should participate in the deceleration of agricultural growth. Thecerealssector(sumofwheat,milledriceandcoarse grains) has already been in such downward trend for some time now, with the growth rate having fallen from 3.7percentp.a.insixties,to2.5percent,1.4percentand 1.1percentp.a.inthesubsequentthreedecadesto2001. Inthislatteryearworldproductionstoodatjustunder1.9 billiontonnes.Ithasgrownfurthersincethentosome2 billiontonnesin2005(preliminaryestimate).Weproject increasestosome3billiontonnesby2050andthiswould afford some increase in world per capita availability to around 340 kg (for all food and non-food uses), some 10percentoverpresentlevels.Itisnotedthatthecurrent level of per capita consumption (309 kg in 1999/01) is lower than what was achieved in the past mainly due to thesharpdeclinesinthetransitioneconomies(theformer socialist countries of the USSR and Eastern Europe) in the 1990s. Recovery in their consumption as well as continuedgrowthinthedevelopingcountriesshouldraise theworldaveragetolevelsithadattainedinthepast(in themid-80s).Agoodpartoftheincreaseinworldcereals consumption should be for animal feed (mostly coarse grains), with the bulk of such consumption increases originating in the developing countries to support the expansionoftheirlivestockproduction. The decline in the growth rate notwithstanding, the absoluteincreasesinvolvedshouldnotbeunderestimated: an increase of world production by another 1.1 billion tonnes annually will be required by 2050 over the 1.9 billion tonnes of 1999/01 (or 1 billion tonnes over the 2 billion of 2005).Achieving it should not be taken for granted, as land and water resources are now more stretchedthaninthepastandthepotentialforcontinued growthofyieldismorelimited. Not all countries will be able to increase cereals productionpari passuwiththeirconsumption.Therefore,

past trends of ever growing net cereal imports of the developing countries should continue and grow to some 300milliontonnes9by2050a2.7-foldincreaseoverthe 112milliontonnesof1999/01.Thisisamuchlowerrate ofincreasecomparedwiththepastwhentheyhadgrown more than 5-fold in 40 years. The novel element in the projectionsisthattransitioneconomiesaretransforming themselves from the large net importers of cereals they were up to the early 1990s (net imports of 43 million tonnes in 1993) to net exporters (18 million tonnes net exports annual average in 2002-04). Such net exports could increase further in the future and, therefore, the traditional cereal exporters (North America, Australia, the EU and the developing exporters) would not have to produce the full surplus needed to cover this growingdeficit. Livestock:Productionandconsumptionofmeatwillalso experienceagrowthdecelerationcomparedwiththehigh growth rates of the past, though the milk sector should accelerate, mainly because of growth in the developing countries demand. The growth of the meat sector had been decisively influenced upwards by the rapid growth of production and consumption in China, and to a smaller extent also Brazil.This upward influence on the world totals was counterbalanced in the 1990s by the drastic shrinkage of the livestock sector in the transition economies, leading to a growth rate in the decade of 2.1percentp.a.vs.3.1percentifthetransitioneconomies dataareexcludedfromtheworldtotals.Theseinfluences willnotbepresentwiththesameforceinthefuture-with theexceptionofcontinuedrapidgrowthofproductionin Brazil (mainly for export). The decline in the transition economieshasalreadybeenreversedwhilethegrowthof meat consumption in China, which grew from 9 kg per capitatomorethan50kginthelastthreedecades,cannot obviouslycontinueatthesamehighratesformuchlonger (see,however,Chapter3foruncertaintiesconcerningthe reliabilityofthelivestockdataofChina). Therestofthedevelopingcountriesstillhassignificant scopeforgrowth,giventhattheirannualpercapitameat consumptionisstillamodest16kg.Someofthisgrowth potential will materialize as effective demand and their percapitaconsumptioncoulddoubleby2050,i.e.faster thaninthepast.Itisunlikelythatothermajordeveloping countries will replicate the role played by China in the past in boosting the world meat sector. In particular,

India'smeatconsumptiongrowthmaynotexertanything like the impact China had in the past, notwithstanding its huge population and good income growth prospects. The country may still have low levels of consumption (though significantly above the current 5 kg) for the foreseeablefuture. Vegetable oils:Thesectorhasbeeninrapidexpansion, fuelled by the growth of food consumption and imports ofthedevelopingcountries.Thegrowthofthenon-food uses (including in recent years for the production of biofuelsinsomecountries)wasalsoamajorfactorinthe buoyancy of the sector, as was the availability of ample expansionpotentialoflandsuitableforthemajoroilcrops - mainly soybeans in SouthAmerica and the oilpalm in South-EastAsia. Indeed, oilcrops have been responsible foragoodpartoftheincreasesintotalcultivatedlandin thedevelopingcountriesandtheworldasawhole.These trends are likely to continue as the food consumption levelsofthedevelopingcountriesarestillfairlylowand theincomeelasticityofdemandforvegetableoilsisstill high in most countries. In parallel, the growing interest inusingvegetableoilsintheproductionofbiofuelsmay provideasignificantboost.Inthisrespect,concernshave been expressed that the rapid expansion of land areas under oilcrops can have significant adverse impacts on the environment, mainly by favouring deforestation. This is just another example of the trade offs between different aspects of sustainability that often accompany development: benefits in terms of reduced emissions of greenhouse gases when biofuels substitute petroleumbased fuels in transport vs. the adverse impacts of landexpansion. Sugar: Thereareanumberoffeaturesthatcharacterize theevolutionofthesectoranddeterminefutureprospects: (a) rapidly rising food consumption in the developing countries (3.2 percent p.a. in the last 30 years); (b) the emergenceofseveralofthemasmajornetimporters(net imports of the deficit developing countries rose from 10 million tonnes to 29 million tonnes over the same period);(c)thegrowingdominanceofBrazilasthemajor low-cost producer and exporter (production rose from 7.5milliontonnesto32milliontonnes10andnetexports from1milliontonnesto11milliontonnesoverthesame period); (d) the growing use of sugar cane as feedstock fortheproductionofbiofuels(ethanol,mainlyinBrazil,

which now uses some 50 percent of cane production for thispurpose);and(e)theprospectthataftermanyyearsof heavyprotectionismofthesugarsectoranddecliningnet importsintheindustrialcountries(whichturnedintonet exportersfromthemid-80s,mainlyduetotheprotection ofthesectorintheEUandthesubstitutionofcorn-based sweeteners for sugar in the USA), the stage may be set forareversalofsuchtrendsandtheresumptionofgrowth intheirimports. Many developing countries, including China, have still low or very low sugar consumption per capita (28 countries have less than 10 kg p.a. and another 18 have 10-20 kg). Therefore, the potential exists for further growth in consumption, though it will not be as vigorousasinthepastwhen60developingcountrieshad less than 20 kg in 1969/71. Depending on the evolution of petroleum prices, sugar cane use as feedstock for the production of biofuels may keep growing in several producing countries (or those that have the resource potential to become major producers). Already several countries have plans to do so. It is possible that this developmentwouldcontributetokeepingthegrowthrate ofworldaggregatedemand(foralluses)andproduction fromdeclininginlinewiththedecelerationinthedemand forfooduses. Roots, Tubers and Plantains: These products play an important role in sustaining food consumption levels in themanycountriesthathaveahighdependenceonthem andlowfoodconsumptionlevelsoverall.Manyofthese countries are in sub-Saharan Africa. In some countries (e.g.Nigeria,Ghana,Benin,Malawi)gainsinproduction following the introduction of improved cultivars have been instrumental in raising the per capita food consumption levels. There is scope for other countries in similar conditions to replicate this experience. This prospect, together with the growing consumption of potatoes in many developing countries, should lead to a reversal of the trend for per capita food consumption of these products to decline ­ a trend that reflected largely the decline of food consumption of sweet potatoes in China. In addition, the potential use of cassava in the production of biofuels (actively pursued in Thailand) wouldfurthersustainthedemandgrowthforthissector.

The growing imports of, mainly, cereals, livestock products, vegetable oils and sugar of many developing countries has resulted in the group of the developing countries as a whole turning from net agricultural exporters to net importers in most years after the early 1990sreachingadeficitofUS$12billionin2000,before recoveringinsubsequentyearsto2004.Therecoveryof recent years reflected above all the explosive growth of Brazil's agricultural exports, including oilseeds and products, meat, sugar, etc. Without Brazil, the deficit of therestofthedevelopingcountries,alreadypresentfrom thelate1980sonwards,grewfurtherfromUS$20billion in 2000 to US$ 27 billion in 2004. Their traditional exportcommodities(tropicalbeverages,bananas,natural rubber,etc)didnotexhibitsimilardynamismandforlong periods stagnated or outright declined (in value terms), withtheexceptionofthegroupfruitandvegetables. The structural factors underlying these trends are likely to continue. The growing food demand in the developing countries will continue to fuel the growth of import requirements of basic foods in many of them, whilethescopeislimitedforgrowthofconsumptionand imports of their traditional exportables to the developed countries. If anything, the growing competition among thedevelopingexporterstosupplythosenearlysaturated markets will continue to put pressure on prices (levels and instability) and lead to shifts in market shares at the expense of the weakest exporters among them, as it happened with coffee in recent years. It may happen with sugar if the preferences protecting the weakest developing exporters were to be diminished or outright removed under the thrust of trade reforms.What will be somewhat different from the past is that the traditional dichotomy developed (net importers) ­ developing (net exporters) will be further blurred: the markets facing the major developing exporters will be increasingly those of the importer developing countries, as it is already happening with commodities such as sugar and vegetableoils.

1.3 Conclusions
The slowdown in world population growth and the attainment of a peak of total population shortly after the middleofthiscenturywillcertainlycontributetoeasing the rate at which pressures are mounting on resources and the broader environment from the expansion and intensificationofagriculture.However,gettingfromhere totherestillinvolvesquantumjumpsintheproductionof several commodities. Moreover, the mounting pressures will be increasingly concentrated in countries with persistinglowfoodconsumptionlevels,highpopulation growth rates and often poor agricultural resource endowments. The result could well be enhanced risk of persistent food insecurity for a long time to come in a numberofcountriesinthemidstofaworldwithadequate foodsuppliesandthepotentialtoproducemore. Theslowdowninthegrowthofworldagriculturemay bemitigatediftheuseofcropbiomassforbiofuelswere to be further increased and consolidated. Were this to happen,theimplicationsforagricultureanddevelopment could be significant for countries with abundant land and climate resources that are suitable for the feedstock crops;assuming,ofcourse,thatimpedimentstobiofuels tradedonotstandontheway.SeveralcountriesinLatin America, South-East Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, including some of the most needy and food-insecure ones,couldbenefit.Whetherandtowhatextentthiswill happen is very uncertain, but the issue deserves serious analysis and evaluation11. Of particular interest are (a) possible adverse effects on the food security of the poor and the food-insecure if food prices were to rise because of resource diversion towards the production of feedstock crops for biofuels; and (b) the environmental implications of cultivated land expansion into pasturelandsandforestedareas.Asnoted,thisisatypical case of possible trade-offs between different aspects of the environment and sustainability: benefits from the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions when biofuels substitute fossil fuels in transport and adverse effects fromtheexpansionandintensificationofagriculture.

2.1.1 Progress made in raising food consumption per person
Food consumption, in terms of kcal/person/day, is the key variable used for measuring and evaluating the evolution of the world food situation1. The world has madesignificantprogressinraisingfoodconsumptionper person.Inthethreedecadesto1999/01,itincreasedfrom

anaverageof2400kcal/person/daytoalmost2800kcal/ person/day(Table2.1).Thisgrowthwasaccompaniedby significantstructuralchange.Dietsshiftedtowardsmore livestock products, vegetable oils, etc. and away from staplessuchasrootsandtubers(Tables2.7and2.8).The increase in world average kcal/person/day would have been even higher but for the declines in the transition economiesinthe1990s. Thegainsintheworldaveragereflectedpredominantly thoseofthedevelopingcountries,giventhattheindustrial countries and the transition economies had fairly high levelsofpercapitafoodconsumptionalreadyinthepast.

This overall progress of the developing countries has beendecisivelyinfluencedbythesignificantgainsmade by the most populous among them. There are currently 8 developing countries with a population of 100 million or more. Of them, only Bangladesh remains at very low levelsoffoodconsumption.China,Indonesia,Braziland Mexicohavemadethetransitiontofairlyhighlevels(in therange2900-3150kcal).Inmorerecentyears(fromthe late 1980s) India and Pakistan also made some progress and are now approaching middling levels of per capita food consumption after long periods of near stagnation (Figure 2.1). Nigeria's data show that the country raised

per capita food consumption significantly to mediumhighlevelsinthedecadestartinginthemid-eighties(but seeBruinsma,2003:37fordataproblemsinNigeria). However, the data on apparent food consumption in some of these large countries reveal some contradictory evidencewhenconfrontedwiththosedepictingthebroader economicsituation.Precisely,andasFigure2.1shows,in India  the gradual rise in apparent average consumption cametoavirtualstandstillinthe1990sandseemstohave remainedstuckataround2400kcal/person/day.Yetitwas inthedecadeofthe1990sthatIndia'seconomicgrowth accelerated and per capita incomes, or rather the more

The "paradoxes" for these two countries are shown in Figure 2.2 together with the case of Korea, Rep. which provides a benchmark of whatconstitutesamore"normal"evolutionarypath,i.e. food consumption growing fast with economic growth andsubsequentlyslowingdown,andeventuallyleveling off, as high levels of around 3000 kcal/person/day were achieved.A closer look at the "paradox" of Nigeria was attempted in Bruinsma (2003: 37) and is attempted here forIndia(Box2.1). An alternative way of looking at changes over the historical period is to observe the distribution of the

populationofthedevelopingworldwholiveincountries having given levels of kcal/person/day. This is a rough and far from perfect approximation to depicting a distributionpatternofworldfoodconsumption,usingthe countryaveragesastheunitofobservationintheabsence of comprehensive within-country distribution data. The relevant data are shown in Table 2.2. The stark changes that took place in the relatively short period of 30 years are vividly depicted: thirty years ago, some 2 billion, or 75percentofthe2.6billionpopulationofthedeveloping countrieslivedin47countries,includingbothChinaand India, with under 2200 kcal/person/day, more than one half of them in countries with under 2000 kcal, China among them. Only six developing countries accounting for a mere 100 million population had over 2700 kcal, a level that is roughly near a threshold for not having significantprevalenceofundernutrition. Thirtyyearsonthesituationhadchangeddramatically: "only" some 600 million (12 percent) of the greatly increased population (4.7 billion) of the developing countries lived in the under 2200 kcal category, while asubstantial2.4billion(51percent)hadshiftedintothe over 2700 kcal category.

Prospects for food and nutrition

Box 2.1 Indian paradox: Near stagnant average food consumption in midst of rapid economic growth
As discussed later (section 2.3 and Chapter 3), much of the slowdown in global cereals consumption has been the result of developments in per capita food consumption of cereals in China and India, which between themselves account for 38 percent of world population. A major issue for the global projections is the extent to which recent developments in these two large countries are indicative of things to come or if these trends may change in the future. To address this issue we first note the significant differences existing in the historical developments in the two countries. In China, the leveling off and subsequent decline in per capita cereals consumption occurred when the country had reached nearly 220 kg/person/year and consumption of all foods was providing 2600+ kcal/person/ day. In parallel with the declines in cereals, the consumption of other foods was increasing leading to the present nearly 3000 kg/person/day (more on China's cereals in Chapter 3, Box 3.2.). In contrast India's per capita cereals consumption started stagnating/declining when it was still relatively low at around 170 kg and when consumption of all food was also low at around 2400 kcal/person/day (or 2150 kcal rural and 2070-2160 urban according to the national consumer expenditure surveys of 1993-94 and 1999-2000 ­ (Dev et al., 2004: tables 8-9). Somewhat higher levels are indicated by nutrition surveys proper, though these are measured in terms of consumption units rather than per capita, Shetty, 2002: tables 5-6). Moreover, the stagnation and/or decline in per capita cereals consumption was not accompanied by any significant increases in the consumption of total food calories, so that the national average is still in the area of 2450 kcal/person/day. The reduction of calories from cereals, and to a smaller extent pulses, was made up mainly by increases in the consumption of vegetable oils, milk, sugar and fruit and vegetables. These developments are assumed to reflect both the influence of standard economic factors (e.g. inadequate growth of incomes of those that would consume more cereals if they could afford them, and prices) but also what goes by the name of "change in tastes and preferences". Several authors emphasize the role of such shifts in tastes, e.g. Dev et al. (2004), Rao (2000), Sen (2005). However, we are still short of explanations why such widespread shifts, that would normally occur when national averages are at levels consonant with significantly reduced undernutrition, seem to occur in India at the very early stages of such nutritional transition when the prevalence of undernutrition is still high. The latter is estimated at 21 percent of the population or 220 million (FAO, 2004a). These estimates are not different from those circulating among national experts, e.g. Paroda (2001): "India still has the world's largest number of poor people (around 250 million) who do not get two square meals a day". To judge from survey data of food intakes, the situation has been getting worse rather than improving, at least in terms of per capita calories consumed (Shariff and Malik, 1999), and this phenomenon is fairly widespread affecting all classes, rural and urban and those below and above the poverty threshold (Sen, 2005: table 5). Some authors (e.g. Saha, 2000) consider that the decline of cereals consumption is a sign of distress rather than of improving welfare favouring diet diversification, indicating that things are getting worse in the rural areas as people have to pay more than before for things like fuel and other basic necessities of life. Of course, this is saying that rural incomes have not improved at anything near the rates implied by the high overall economic growth rates, if at all. In which case, the near stagnant levels of national average food consumption may not be much of a paradox. Overall, however, one should be careful in taking at face value the calorie data coming from the surveys (similar reservations apply, of course, to the FAO estimates of apparent food consumption based on the food balance sheets). Such surveys seem to consistently show significant underconsumption of the population groups at the bottom of the income distribution scale. For example, in ten of India's 16 States the poorest (by expenditure) 20 percent of the population had in 1999-2000 calories in the range in the range 1300-1600. Worse, in 1983 the poorest 20 percent are shown as having had calories in the range 850-1360 in 3 States (Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka - Meenakshi and Vishwanathan, 2003, Table 6). Nutritionists would say these levels are hardly sufficient for survival and minimal activity if persons are permanently subjected to them even after accounting for differences among States in population characteristics (age/sex structures, body weight). Apparently this result reflects, inter alia, exclusion of the food consumed by employees in their employers' households. In India's National Sample Surveys such food is counted as part of the latters' food consumption (Minhas, 1991). In conclusion, we should evaluate carefully the reliability of the survey data before drawing conclusions about developments in India's food consumption levels.

11

National income data can help us examine the issue in an international context. India's per capita GDP in the year 2000 was 2220 PPP$ of 19952 (World Bank, 2004) when per capita apparent food consumption was 2410 kcal/person day. This relationship is not at all "abnormal" in a cross-country comparison: there are 11 developing countries3 with GDP in the neighbourhood of that of India (PPP$ 2200 plus/minus $500) and they all have kcal/person/day in the range 2000-2600, with India being right in the middle of the range. Going by analogy, in the future India should be somewhere near the middle of the range of countries with incomes in the neighbourhood of what India will have at that time. Assuming the growth rate of per capita GDP of the last 10 years (4.1 percent p.a.) were to apply also to the period to 2030, India's per capita GDP should rise by 2030 to PPP$ 7400 of 1995. Countries that currently have incomes in range PPP$ 7400 plus/minus $10004, have kcal/person/ day in the range 2700-3150. Therefore, India's average national food consumption rising to around 2800 kcal by 2030 would not be out of place in the projections. Were this to happen, it would imply a significant reduction in undernutrition for the country and the world. To judge from survey data, Indians do move up the calorie scale as incomes increase: in six of India's 16 States the richest (by expenditure) 20 percent of the population had over 3000 kcal/person/day while the bottom 20 percent had calories in the range 1713-2228 (Meenakshi and Vishwanathan, 2003, Table 6). As incomes rise and poverty is reduced5, those in the less well off segments of the population can be expected to behave vis-à-vis food more like those in the better-off groups currently.

2.1.3 The prevalence of undernourishment­ past and present
ThelatestFAOassessment,The State of Food Insecurity in the World 2004 (FAO, 2004a), estimates the total prevalence of undernourishment in the developing countries at 813 million persons in 2000/02 (17 percent of their population - Table 2.3)7, when average food consumptionreached2650kcal/person/day.Thisestimate isnotsignificantlydifferentfromthatoftenyearsearlier, the3-yearaverage1990/92(823million),althoughthen itrepresentedahigherproportionoftheirtotalpopulation (20 percent). The 3-year average 1990/92 was the base used by the 1996 World Food Summit (WFS) in setting the target of halving the numbers undernourished in the developingcountriesby2015atthelatest.

Thisslightdeclinerepresentsvirtuallynoprogressin the first ten years of the 25-year period set by the WFS for attaining the target. In practice, declines achieved in East Asia were compensated by increases in the other two regions with the highest concentrations - subSaharanAfrica and SouthAsia. If these trends continue, the halving target will certainly not be achieved and whatever reductions take place will further accentuate the divide between countries making progress and those fallingbehind. Changes in the prevalence of undernourishment are close correlates of changes in food consumption levels (kcal/person/day), as explained in Box 2.2. The historical data in Table 2.1 show that food consumption levels have improved greatly for most regions over the last three decades. Such improvement must have been accompanied by a lowering of the prevalence of undernourishment also in the years before 1990/92. By implication, undernourishment must have been much higher in the past, e.g. in 1969/71 when there were only 2110 kcal/person/day on the average in the developing countries. Estimates for that period indicate 960 million whichwas37percentofthepopulation8.

7 The term "undernourishment" is used to refer to the status of persons whose food intake does not provide enough calories to meet their basic energy requirements. The term "undernutrition" denotes the status of persons whose anthropometric measurements indicate the outcome not only, or not  necessarily,ofinadequatefoodintakebutalsoofpoorhealthandsanitation-conditionsthatmaypreventthemfromderivingfullnutritionalbenefitfrom what they eat (FAO, 1999: 6). 8 Estimates in http://www.fao.org/faostat/foodsecurity/index_en.htm.

Box 2.2 Measuring the prevalence of undernourishment: the key role of the estimates of food available for direct human consumption9
The key data used for estimating the prevalence of undernourishment are those of food available for direct human consumption. These data are derived in the framework of the national Food Balance Sheets (FBS ­ explanations in http://faostat.fao.org/faostat/agricult/cbcp-e-e.htm). The latter are constructed on the basis of countries' reports on their production and trade of food commodities. The part used as food is derived after deduction of estimates and/or allowances for non-food uses and for losses (excluding losses at the household or individual level10. Such losses can be considerable ­ see estimates for the USA in Kantor, 1998). The population data are used to express these food availabilities into per capita terms (kg/person/year, then converted to kcal/ person/day). The resulting numbers are taken as proxies for actual national average food consumption. For many countries the thus estimated per capita food consumption of the different commodities are totally inadequate for good nutrition, hence the relatively high estimates of the prevalence of undernourishment reported for them. This conclusion is inferred from a comparison of the estimated kcal/person/day shown in the FBS data with what would be required for good nutrition. The parameters for the latter are well known11, though not devoid of controversy. In the first place, there is the amount of food (or dietary) energy that is needed for the human body to function at rest (breathe, pump blood, etc.) even without allowing for movement or activity. This is the Basal or Resting Metabolic Rate (BMR or RMR). It is in the general range 1300-1700 kcal/day for adults in different physiological conditions (age, sex, height, bodyweight). Taking the age/sex structure and body-weights of the adult populations of the different countries, their national average BMRs for adults are estimated. These refer to the amount of energy as a national average per adult person that must be actually absorbed if all were in a state of rest and inactivity. For children, in addition to the BMR, an additional allowance needs to be made for the requirements for adequate growth and in the case of pregnant and lactating (nursing) mothers for the proper growth of the foetus and for the lactation needs of the growing infant.

Prospects for food and nutrition

When an allowance for light activity is added, estimated to be about 54 percent of the BMR, there results a range of between 1720 kcal and 1965 kcal person/day for the different developing countries given their population structures in 2000 (average: 1840). This will rise to 1820-1980 kcal by 2050 (average: 1913) when the demographic structure will be different, with a higher proportion of adults. It follows that population groups in which an average individual has habitually an intake below this level (the threshold) are undernourished because they do not eat enough to maintain health, body weight and to engage in light activity. The result is physical and mental impairment. Characteristics for the former are evidenced in nutritional anthropometric surveys. Estimating the prevalence of undernourishment means estimating the proportion of population with food intakes below these thresholds. It is noted that the notion, measurement and definition of thresholds of requirements are not devoid of controversy. For example, Svedberg (2001:12) considers that the thresholds used in the FAO measurement of undernourishment for the tropical countries are too high leading to overestimates of undernourishment12. In principle, a country having national average kcal/person/day equal to the threshold would have no undernourishment problem provided all persons engage in only light activity and each person had access to food exactly according to his/her respective requirements. However, this is never the case; some people consume (or have access to) more food than their respective "light activity" requirements (e.g. because they engage in more energy-demanding work or have high household waste or simply overeat) and other people less than their requirement (usually because they cannot afford more). Thus, an allowance must be made for such unequal access. Empirical evidence suggests that the inequality measure used in these estimates ­ the coefficient of variation (CV) ­ ranges from 0.2 to 0.36 in the different countries (a CV of 0.2 means, roughly, that the average difference of the food intake of individuals from the national average - the standard deviation - is 20 percent of the national average). Even at the lowest level of inequality generally found in the empirical data (CV=0.2), the national average kcal/person/day must be well above the threshold if the proportion of population undernourished is to be very low. For example, a country with threshold 1800 kcal and CV=0.20, must have a national average of 2700 kcal/person/day if the proportion undernourished is to be only 2.5 percent, or 2900 if it is to be 1 percent. Naturally, if inequality were more pronounced, these requirements would be higher. These numbers, or norms, are, therefore, a first guide to assessing the adequacy or otherwise of the national average food consumption levels in the FBS data and expressed in kcal/person/day. This latter number is the principal variable used to generate estimates of the prevalence of undernourishment as explained elsewhere (FAO, 1996b; more technical discussion in Naiken, 2003)13. Numerous countries fall below the national average energy level (kcal/person/day) required for undernourishment to be very low, in many cases they fall below by considerable margins. Therefore, even if one knew nothing more about the prevalence of undernourishment, the inevitable conclusion for these countries is that it must be significant, ranging from moderate to high or very high, even when inequality of access to food is moderate. It follows that progress towards reducing or eliminating undernourishment must manifest itself, in the first place, in the form of increased per capita food consumption. Naturally, this is not equivalent to saying that the food consumption shown in the FBS data is itself a variable which can be operated upon directly by policy. For it to rise, somebody must consume more food, and the food must come from somewhere ­ production or imports. The policies to raise national average consumption are those which enhance the purchasing power and more general access to food of those who would consume more if they had the means, for example, access to resources and technologies to improve their own food production capacities, access to non-farm employment, social policies, etc. The point made here is that changes in the national average kcal/person/day recorded in the FBS data do signal the direction and magnitude of movement towards improved or worsened food security status. How reliable are the FBS data, since in many cases they show very low or very high levels of national average food consumption or sudden spurts or collapses? The answer is: they are as reliable as, mainly, the primary data on production and trade supplied by the countries, as well as the estimates made for non-food uses and losses of food commodities and the population data used to express them in per capita terms14. It is these data and estimates that are processed, in the form of the FBS, to derive the indicators of per capita food consumption as national averages used here. Given the primary data, the conclusion that many countries are in a difficult food security situation follows logically and inevitably.

12 Work is currently underway to revise the thresholds used in the estimation of undernourishment. 13 These key variables (kcal/person/day and the CV) are used as parameters of the lognormal statistical distribution (with kcal/person/day as the mean) to estimate the percentage of population undernourished. 14 In some cases the population data themselves are a prime source of errors in the estimates of food consumption per capita (for the case of Nigeria, see Bruinsma, 2003, Box 2.2).

2.2 The outlook for food and nutrition to 2015, 2030 and 2050
2.2.1 Demographics
The population data and projections used here are those of the United Nations World Population Prospects-the 2002 Revision(UN,2003).Theprojectionsindicatethat aratherdrasticslowdowninworlddemographicgrowth is in prospect. The data and projections are shown in Table2.4.Theworldpopulationof6071billionof2000 is projected to grow to 8130 million in 2030 and to 8920 million in 2050. The growth rate of world population peaked in the second half of the 1960s at 2.04 percent p.a. and had fallen to 1.35 percent p.a. by the second half of the 1990s. Further deceleration will bring it down to 0.7 percent in 2025-30 and to 0.33percentby2045-50. Despitethedrasticfallinthegrowthrate,theabsolute annual increments continue to be large. Seventy nine million persons were added to world population every year in the second half of the 1990s and the number will remain at over 50 million p.a. until the mid-2030s. More rapid declines after 2035 should bring the annual increment down to 26 million by 2050. Practically all these increases will be in the developing countries. Within the developing countries themselves, there will be increasing differentiation. East Asia will have shifted to negative demographic growth (-0.2 percent p.a.) in the last five years of the projection period. At the other extreme, sub-SaharanAfrica's population will still be growing at 1.2 percent p.a. in the same period

2045-50, despite the drastic downward revision made in recent years in the region's population projections. By 2050, 18 million of the 26 million added annually to world population will be in sub-Saharan Africa. Some countries, mostly in Africa, have demographic projections suggesting that their populations in 2050 would be rather sizeable multiples of their current ones. Thisprospectraisestheseriousissuewhethersignificant improvements in food consumption and nutrition could be achieved in the foreseeable future (see discussion in Box 2.3). In conclusion, rapid population growth could continue to be an important impediment to achieving improvements in food security in some countries, even whenworldpopulationceasesgrowing.

Box 2.3 Countries with high population growth for 50 years and limited agricultural resources: An untenable combination?15
A key characteristic of the demographic outlook, which is not so evident in medium term projections but leaps to the eye in projections of 50 years ahead, is the prospect that a number of countries could have in 2050 populations which are large multiples of present ones. As shown in Table 2.4 world population is projected to be in 2050 47 percent above that of 2000 and that of the developing countries 59 percent. In contrast, the population of Niger (the country with the highest total fertility rate in the world of 8 children per woman at present and projected to still hold this record with 3.85 children in 2050) is projected to grow from 10.7 million in 2000 to 53 million in 2050, an almost 5-fold increase. In like manner, Yemen's population would grow from 18 million to 84 million, Ethiopia's from 65 to 170 million, Uganda's from 23.5 to 103 million, and so on for a number of other countries. Almost all of these countries have been in nearly perennial food insecurity for several decades. The issue is therefore raised if and to what extent significant progress in development and food security can be achieved under the rapidly mounting population pressure implied by the demographic projections. The issue is of paramount importance for those countries with large and growing rural populations and heavy dependence of their economies on their own agriculture for income, employment, food supplies and for providing the basis for their overall development. Countries falling in this category which also have agricultural resources that are limited in quantity and/or quality (e.g. predominantly semi-arid, little irrigation potential) and are not endowed with other resources (e.g. oil, mining) will find it much more difficult than other low-income countries to reduce poverty and make adequate progress in food security. The food and agriculture projections cannot avoid recognizing this prospect and highlight the possibility that food insecurity could continue to be a dominant characteristic in a number of countries for several decades to come. More generally, the demographic projections themselves (i.e. the underlying assumptions about fertility, mortality and migration) may have to be revisited and re-assessed in the light of prima facie incompatibilities between population growth and agricultural potentials in countries where the latter are of crucial importance for development. The just released (in early 2005) 2004 revision of the UN demographic projections (UN, 2005a) did modify the projections of the 2002 revision (used here) for some of these countries, but not always in the direction of making them more compatible with agricultural potentials. For example, Yemen's 2050 population is now projected to be 59 million rather 84 million, but for Uganda the revision is in the opposite direction: 127 million in 2050, up from the 103 million of the 2002 projection; and Niger's projection remains almost unchanged at 50 million in 2050.

In the former, a further acceleration of the relatively high growthratesofthepastholdspromiseofpositiveimpact on poverty alleviation (see below). However, progress may be very limited in sub-Saharan Africa, with per capita incomes growing at only 1.7 percent p.a. in the periodto2015.Thisiscertainlymuchbetterthanthepast whichwascharacterizedbydecliningincomes.However, itwillbefarfromsufficienttomakeasignificantdenton povertyandfoodinsecurityinthemediumtermfuture. TheseWorldBankprojectionsandextensionsto2030 haveprovidedthebasisfordefiningtheGDPprojections used as exogenous assumptions in the present study. Projections for the period 2030-50 were formulated by the authors of this study, largely on the assumption of continuationofthegrowthoftheperiodto2030,butwith someimportantexceptions.TheyareshowninTable2.5. Theexogenouseconomicgrowthassumptionsusedhere, together with the growth of population, are the major determinants of projected food consumption, though by no means are they the only ones. Many other factors besides population and average GDP growth influence the apparent levels and commodity composition of food consumption and have to be taken into account in the process of all phases of analytical and evaluation work concerning consumption, production and trade (see methodological notes in Bruinsma, 2003, Appendix 2). As noted (Figure 2.2), there are several countries where

the evolution of average per capita income (as recorded in the national accounts data) seems to bear little relationshiptotheevolutionoftheaverageapparentfood consumption as revealed in the Food Balance Sheets. For some countries, particularly those with severe food insecurity problems, it is often the evolution of local food production that dominates developments in food consumption(Bruinsma,2003:45-47). One of the important questions we shall be asking below is the extent to which such projected food demand will be associated with reductions in undernourishment. Since undernourishment is more often than not closely correlated with poverty, it is relevant to ask to what extent the economic growth and development outlook we use as exogenous assumptions are compatible with poverty reduction. We have no way of exploring poverty implicationsforthelongtermhorizonweuseinthisstudy. However,theempiricalevidencethateconomicgrowthis correlated with reduction of poverty (defined as numbers of people, or population proportions, living on e.g. US$1orUS$2adayorless)suggeststhatthepositive growth rates assumed here (Table 2.5) do imply poverty reductions,thoughwecannotsaybyhowmuch.Someidea of the magnitudes involved in this relationship between economic growth and poverty reduction can be had from the World Bank's projections of poverty associated with thoseofthepercapitaGDPsto2015inFigure2.4.

It is noted, however, that poverty and undernourishment are not identical concepts, in particular as concerns the settings of threshold levels for defining them (for discussion, see FAO,2001:10).

Further declines would practically eliminate poverty (of the US$1/daydefinition)intheregionby2015; South Asia is also projected to make great strides in reducing significantly (though by no means eliminating) poverty by 2015. Indeed these two regions of Asia will account for the totality of furtherreductionsinpovertybetween2002and2015 (200millioneach); In contrast, the absolute numbers in poverty in subSaharan Africa kept increasing in the 1990s and are projected to continue to do so until 2015, though not as fast as in the past.

These rises are not always an unmixed blessing as thediettransitionsexperiencedbymanycountriesimply changes in diets towards energy-dense ones high in fat, particularly saturated fat, sugar and salt and low in unrefined carbohydrates. In combination with lifestyle changes, largely associated with rapid urbanization, such transitions, while beneficent in many countries with still inadequate diets, are often accompanied by a corresponding increase in diet-related chronic Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs ­ WHO, 2003; Schmidhuber and Shetty, 2005; Alexandratos, 2006). In many countries undergoing this transition, obesityrelated NCDs appear when health problems related to undernutrition of significant parts of their populations arestillwidelyprevalent.Thetwoproblemsco-existand these countries are confronted with a "double burden of malnutrition"resultinginnovelchallengesandstrainsin theirhealthsystems.

Modest reductions in the numbers undernourished
The relatively high average consumption levels that the developing countries may attain  in the future (Table 2.1) could lead one to expect that the problem of undernourishmentwillbesolvedorbewellonitswayto solution, in the sense that the numbers undernourished should show significant declines. This would be the corollary of what was said earlier about the importance ofthepercapitafoodconsumptionasthemajorvariable thatisaclosecorrelateofthelevelofundernourishment.

Yet the estimates presented in Table 2.3 show that reductions would be rather modest: the 810 million of 1999/01 (17.2 percent of the population) may become 580 million in 2015 (10.1 percent), 460 million in 2030 (6.9percent)and290million(3.9percent)by2050.For thedevelopingcountriesasawhole,wemayhavetowait until after 2030 before the numbers of undernourished are reduced to the target set for 2015 by the WFS, i.e. one half of the 823 million estimated for the base period of 1990/92. It is noted that the UN Millennium Development Target refers not to halving the numbers undernourished but rather to "halve, between 1990 and 2015,theproportionofpeoplewhosufferfromhunger" (UN, 2005b). In this sense, the Target may be achieved in 2015, as the proportion falls from the 20.3 percent in 1990/92totheprojected10.1percentin2015. These findings indicate that achieving significant declines in the prevalence of undernourishment may prove to be more arduous than commonly thought. A combinationofhighernationalaveragefoodconsumption and reduced inequality (see below for assumptions) can have a significant impact on the proportion of the population undernourished. However, when population growthisaddedin,suchgainsdonotnecessarilytranslate into commensurate declines in the absolute numbers, because the population of the developing countries will havegrownfrom4.7billionin2000to5.8billionin2015 and7.5billionin2050(Table2.4). The numbers of undernourished are expected to decreaselittleby2015insub-SaharanAfricaandtheywill stillbeabovethoseoftheWFSbasein1990/92.Asmall decline is no doubt an improvement over the historical trend of nearly stagnant food consumption per capita in the region and rising numbers of undernourished. It is, however,farfromwhatisneededtomeettheWorldFood Summittargetofreducingthenumbersbyhalfbynolater than 2015. In contrast, rather significant reductions are expected for EastAsia and to a smaller extent for South Asia,thetworegionsthatcontainthebulkoftheworld's undernourishedpopulation.EastAsiaisexpectedtohave more than halved undernourishment by 2015 from base 1990/92 (it had already reduced it by 22 percent in the period 1990/92-2000/02) and South Asia could achieve thistargetshortlyafter2030. In order to appreciate why these prospects emerge, let us recall briefly that future estimates are generated by applying the same method FAO uses for estimating presentundernourishment.Theonlydifferenceisthatwe usethefuturevaluesforthosevariablesforeachcountry that we project, or can assume, to be different from the

The per capita food consumption in kcal/person/ day, taken as a proxy for actual average national consumption. Future values are derived from the projections of per capita food consumption for One factor making for the slow decline in the each commodity discussed in detail elsewhere (Chapter 3) and summarized in Tables 2.7 and 2.8 numbers of undernourished is the gradual rise in the (major commodities) as well as in Table 2.1 (kcal/ thresholdforclassifyingapersonasundernourished.As noted,thisriseisduetothegrowingshareofadultsinthe person/day); population.The(simplearithmetic)averagethresholdof n The threshold (or cut-off level) of food energy the developing countries rises from 1840 kcal in 2000 (kcal/day) a person must have in order not to be to1875kcalin2030andto1913kcalin2050.Thisrise undernourished.

Taking into account population growth, aggregate demand for food (expressed in calories) is projected to grow at 3.3 percent p.a. in the 15 years to 2015.Thiscontrastswiththeexperienceofthepastfour decades when the highest growth rate achieved in any 15-yearperiod(1961-76,1962-77,...,1986-01,1987-02) was2.9percentp.a.(andthelowest1.6percent).Overall, therefore, the projections of food consumption and of production,farfrombeingpessimistic,embodyadegree of optimism. This projected acceleration is clearly seen in Figure 2.5 which  shows the history and projections forthisgroupofcountries.Theprojectedimprovementis partlyjustifiedbytheprospectofrecoveryofagriculture followingeventualcessationofwarorwarlikeconditions that are, or were recently, present in several countries in this group. Empirical evidence suggests that in such situationsbetterperformanceofagricultureisakeyfactor in making possible rapid increases in food consumption (Bruinsma, 2003: 45-47). Similar considerations apply, mutatis mutandis, to other countries which start from low or very low per capita food consumption and high undernourishment and also have fairly high population growthrates. In conclusion, rapid reductions in the numbers of undernourished require the creation of conditions that will lead to hefty increases in national average food consumption in countries starting with low levels, as well as to lower inequality of access to food. Countries

with high population growth rates will need stronger doses of policies in that direction than countries with slower growth rates. The projections of population and the overall economic growth used here, and the derived projections of food demand and consumption, indicate that in many countries the decline in the numbers of undernourished will be a slow process. Moreover, in several countries with high population growth rates the absolute numbers of undernourished are projected to increaseratherthandeclineby2015.Asnoted(Box2.3), the countries which, in addition to high demographic growth,alsohavelimitedagriculturalresourcesandhigh dependence on agriculture, will find it most difficult to achievesignificantimprovements.

2.3 Structural changes in the commodity composition of food consumption
The growth in per capita food consumption was accompanied by significant change in the commodity composition, at least in the countries that experienced suchgrowth.Therelevantdataandprojectionsareshown inTables2.7and2.8. Much of the structural change in the diets of the developing countries concerned the rapid increases of livestockproducts(meat,milk,eggs),vegetableoilsand, to a smaller extent, sugar, as sources of food calories. Thesethreefoodgroupstogethernowprovide29percent oftotalfoodconsumptionofthedevelopingcountries(in

termsofcalories),upfrom20percentthreedecadesago. Their share is projected to rise further to 35 percent in 2030andto37percentin2050(intheindustrialcountries thesharehasbeenaround48percentforseveraldecades now). However, structural change was not universal and wide inter-country diversity remains in the share of different commodity groups in total food consumption. The major changes, past and projected, are briefly reviewed below. Further discussion of developments in themaincommoditysectorsispresentedinChapter3. Cereals continue to be by far the most important source of total food consumption in the developing countries (their direct food consumption provides 54 percent of total calories) and the world as a whole (50 percent).There is, however, very wide inter-country diversity: direct food consumption of cereals provides only 15-30 percent of total calories in several countries ranging from those with diets based predominantly on rootsandtubers(e.g.Rwanda,Burundi,thetwoCongos, Uganda, Ghana, etc.) to several high income countries with predominantly livestock-based diets (these latter countries consume, of course, large quantities of cereals indirectlyintheformofanimalfeedfortheproductionof thelivestockproductstheyconsumeasfood).Attheother extreme,countrieswithrice-baseddietslikeBangladesh, orthosewithdietsbasedoncoarsegrains(e.g.Lesotho, Burkina Faso) continue to derive 70-80 percent of total foodcaloriesfromcereals. Per capita food use of cereals19 seems to have peaked in the early 1990s, and this is true for the world as a whole (per capita apparent consumption fell from 171 kg/person/year in 1989/91 to 165 kg in 1999/01) as well as for the aggregate of the developing countries (from 174 kg to 166 kg). This of course raises the question why the average of the developing countries shouldbelevelingoffwhensomanyofthemarefarfrom having reached adequate levels of food consumption. Addressing this question requires that we look in some moredetailattheexperiencesoftheindividualcountries. In practice, the peak and subsequent decline reflects primarily developments in China and India. Per capita foodconsumptionofcerealsdeclinedinChinainthelast few years while it stagnated and declined somewhat in the1990sinIndia.AcommentaryonIndiaisprovidedin Box2.1andonChinainChapter3(Box3.2) These two large countries account for 38 percent of world population and for 48 percent of that of the

developing countries. Therefore trends in their values influence decisively the global totals. Excluding these twolargecountriesfromthetotals,theaveragesforboth theworldandthedevelopingcountrieskeptincreasingin the 1990s, albeit very slowly. This very slow growth in themidstofstillsignificantundernutritionisacomposite of both positive and negative factors in operation. On the negative side, there are the experiences of the many countrieswhosedeclinesinfoodcerealsconsumptionis partofthebroaderpictureoffailuresinthefoodsecurity area discussed in the preceding section. Countries in this class include Iraq, Afghanistan, Rwanda, Burundi, Somaliaandseveralothers.Onthepositiveside,thereare theexperiencesofthosecountrieswhosedeclinesinfood cerealsarebroadlypartandparcelofthewellestablished pattern of diet diversification away from staples like cereals towards more preferred foods. Countries in this class include several of those in the middle and upper middleincomeclasses,e.g.Taiwan(ProvinceofChina), Korea,Rep.,Turkey,Tunisia,Syria,etc. Concerning the future, the downward pressure from developments in China and India on the averages of the world and the developing countries will be attenuated and on balance the declines in these averages observed in the last few years may be halted at least in the first sub-period of the projections to 2030 before resuming a slowpaceofdeclineinthetwosubsequentdecades.This likelydevelopmentwillbetheneteffectofthecontrasting trendsof,ontheonehand,dietdiversificationawayfrom the direct consumption of cereals in those countries attaining medium-high levels of food consumption, and on the other hand, increases in per capita consumption in those countries remaining at low levels of food consumption and/or diversifying towards cereals and awayfromotherstaples,e.g.rootsandtubers.Theshare of cereals in total calories will continue to decline, but very slowly, falling for the developing countries from 54 percent at present to 49 percent in 2030 and to 46 percentin2050.Naturally,thepercapitaconsumptionof cereals for all uses (including food, feed and other nonfood uses, e.g. for seed and the production of ethanol or starch) should keep growing again after the reversal of the sharp declines of the 1990s in the feed sector of the transitioneconomies(Table2.7andChapter3). Concerningthelikelydevelopmentsintheindividual cereals (wheat, rice, coarse grains) much of the slowdown in per capita food consumption will continue

to originate in the declines in per capita consumption of rice,awellestablishedtrendinthemajorcountrieswith predominantly rice-based diets, particularly those in the East Asia region. In contrast, wheat food consumption grewthefastestofallcerealsinthepastandwillcontinue to do so in the future. Such growth in consumption will be accompanied by continued growth in wheat imports inmanydevelopingcountries,particularlythosethatare non-producers or minor producers for agro-ecological reasons(seeChapter3). Food consumption of coarse grainshasdeclinedon average, but continues to be important mainly in subSaharanAfrica(whereitaccountsfor70percentoffood consumption of cereals, with some countries depending overwhelmingly on maize ­ Zimbabwe, Zambia, etc. ­ and others mostly on millet and sorghum ­ mostly the countries in the Sudano-Sahelian zone) and to a smaller extent in Latin America (42 percent, mostly maize). The decline in other regions, particularly in China, has brought down the average for the developing countries. In future, smaller declines inAsia and some recovery in sub-SaharanAfrica could halt the trend towards decline oftheaverageofthedevelopingcountries.Developments in maize use for the production of sweeteners (which in ourdataappearsasfooddemandformaize)haveboosted the food consumption of coarse grains in the industrial countries,mainlyintheUSA,whereHFCShasreplaced a good part of sugar. Aggregate demand for coarse grainswillbeincreasinglyinfluencedbythedemandfor animal feed and, in some countries, for the production of biofuels. As discussed in Chapter 3, the developing countrieswillbeplayingagrowingroleintheworldtotal demandandtradeofcoarsegrains. Wide inter-country differences in cereals food consumption will continue to persist. Several countries havepercapitafoodconsumptionofcerealsunder100kg/ year,somebelow50kg(CongoDR,Burundi,Rwanda). These persistently low levels reflect a combination of agroecological factors (favouring dependence of diets on roots and tubers, bananas and plantains, in countries mainly in the humid tropics) as well as prevalence of povertyanddepressedlevelsoffoodconsumptionoverall. It is worth noting that Africa includes countries at the

two extremes of the cereals consumption spectrum: the countries with the highest food consumption of cereals arealsoinAfrica,namelythoseinNorthAfrica,butalso Niger, Burkina Faso and Lesotho, with per capita levels intherangefrom200to250kg. Livestock products: The diversification of diet in developing countries has been most visible in the shift towards meat, milk and eggs. Here again there is very wide diversity between countries as regards both the levelsofconsumptionachievedaswellasthespeedwith which the transformation has been taking place. Several developing countries have traditionally had high meat consumption, comparable to the levels of the industrial countries.Theyincludethetraditionalmeatexportersof Latin America (e.g. Argentina, Uruguay), but also the occasionalcountrywithpredominantlypastoraleconomy, e.g.Mongolia.However,developmentsinthesecountries are not what caused the structural change in the diets of thedevelopingcountriestowardsmoremeat.Ifanything, they slowed it down as the per capita consumption in many of them either remained flat or actually declined. Therealforcebehindthestructuralchangehasbeenrapid growthinconsumptionoflivestockproductsincountries like China19 (including Taiwan Province and the Hong Kong SAR), Korea Rep., Malaysia, Chile, Brazil and several countries in the Near East/North Africa region. Indeed, as discussed in Chapter 3, the increase of meat consumption of the developing countries from 11 to 27kginthelastfourdecadeswasdecisivelyinfluenced by the rapid growth in China and Brazil. Excluding themfromthetotals,theaverageoftheotherdeveloping countries grew much less over the same period, from 11kgtoonly16kg20(Table2.7).Giventheuncertainties surrounding China's meat statistics, it is perhaps a bit exaggeratedtospeakofa"meatrevolution"takingplace inthedevelopingcountriesandtheworld. Inthefuturewemaywitnessasignificantslowdown in the growth of demand for meat, notwithstanding the prospect that per capita consumption in the latter group of countries (developing minus China and Brazil) could grow somewhat faster than in the past, rising from thepresent16kgto26by2030andto32kgby2050 (Table 2.7). However the large weight in the world

19 The reliability of the meat sector data in China has been questioned (Ma et al., 2004). If the data actually overstate China's meat production by a considerable margin, the country's impact on the world meat economy and particularly the aggregates of the developing countries would have been more modest in the past, and could be more important in the future, than suggested here. 20 These data for meat consumption refer only to the traditional meats constituting the great bulk of aggregate consumption, i.e. bovine, ovine, pigmeat    and poultry. Other meats (horse, camel, rabbit and game) are not included in the estimates given here. They add to the world average of 37.4 kg another0.8kg.However,theseothermeatsaresignificantfoodsourcesinanumberofcountries,e.g.theyadd24kgtothepercapitameat consumptioninMongolia,animportant5-10kginsomeAfricancountrieswhichsignificantlyincreasesthemeatconsumptionfromthemoretraditional animals.

Prospects for food and nutrition

meat totals of the developed countries, as well as some major developing ones (e.g. China and Brazil and some othersmid-highincomecountrieswithmuchlessgrowth potential than the rest of the developing countries given the high or medium-high levels already achieved), together with the slower global population growth, means that aggregate world demand would grow at muchlowerratesthaninthepast.Theprospectsareslim that other large developing countries such as India will emerge as major meat consumers, due to a continuation of low incomes and the influence of dietary preferences favouringmeatlessthaninothersocieties.Thus,theboost giveninthepasttoworldmeatconsumptionbythesurge inChina(butseefootnote19)isunlikelytobereplicated byothercountrieswiththesameforceinthefuture.The majorstructuralchangesthatcharacterizedthehistorical evolution of the world livestock economy, particularly inthe1990s,arelikelytocontinue,thoughinsomewhat attenuated form. These changes are the growing role of the poultry sector in total meat production, and the growingshareoftradeinworldoutputandconsumption (seeChapter3). The other major commodity group with very high consumption growth in the developing countries is that of vegetable oils.The rapid growth in consumption, in combinationwiththehighcaloriecontentofoilsandother oilcrop products21, have been instrumental in bringing about the increases in apparent food consumption (kcal/person/day) of the developing countries, that characterized the progress in food security achieved in the past. Three decades ago, consumption of oilcrop products (4.9 kg/person/year, in oil equivalent) supplied only 136 kcal/person/day, or 6.5 percent of the total availabilityof2110caloriesofthedevelopingcountries. By1999/01consumptionpercapitahadgrownto10.4kg contributing272kcaltototalfoodsupplies,or10percent ofatotalwhichitselfhadrisento2650kcal.Inpractice, one out of every four calories added to the consumption of the developing countries over this period originated in this group of products (see further discussion of the oilcrops sector in Chapter 3). In the future, vegetable oils are likely to retain, and indeed strengthen, their primacyasmajorcontributorstofurtherincreasesinfood consumptionofthedevelopingcountries:38outofevery 100additionalcaloriesmaycomefromtheseproductsin theperiodto2050.

population. In three of them, the dependence is over 50 percent (Congo DR, Rwanda, Ghana). Most have low overall per capita food consumption (13 of them have under 2200 calories of which six under 2000) and, consequently, high prevalence of undernourishment. Cereals, which in the developing countries as a whole provide54percentoftotalfoodcalories,accountinthese countries for much smaller proportions, typically 20-45 percent, rising to just over 50 percent only in Tanzania (mostlymaize)andMadagascar(rice).Atthesametime, the region contains countries at the other extreme of the spectrum with only minimal consumption of roots and tubers,e.g.Mali,Mauritania,Niger,Sudan,etc. TheFoodBalanceSheetsdatashowthatinseveralof the countries with high dietary dependence on roots and tubers,whathappenstotheproductionofthesecropsisan importantdeterminantofchangesinthenationalaverage food consumption.As in the case of Nigeria mentioned earlier, other countries (Ghana, Benin, Malawi, Peru) also experienced significant increases in per capita food consumption which originated to a large extent in the increases of roots and tubers production. Despite these country examples, the evolution over time shows declining per capita food consumption of starchy foods forthedevelopingcountriesandtheworldasawholeup toaboutthelate1980s,followedbysomerecoveryinthe 1990s (Table 2.7).These developments were due to two mainfactors: n the rapid decline in food consumption of sweet potatoes in China (from a peak of some 100 kg three decadesagotothesome40kgatpresent),theparallel rise in that of potatoes, in both China (from 14 kg to 36 kg) and the rest of the developing countries (from 9kgto16kg),and

developing countries, and average food consumption is projected to increase. Another factor that could raise consumptionisthepotentialforproductivityincreasesin the other root crops (cassava, yams). It will be possible for more countries in sub-Saharan Africa to replicate theexperiencesofcountrieslikeNigeria,Ghana,Benin, Malawi, and increase their food consumption based on rapid production improvements in these crops (Nweke, 2004;Babaleye,2005). Sugar sharesmanyofthecharacteristicsofvegetable oils as regards food consumption and trade of the developing countries: it is a fast-rising consumption itemandamajorexportcommodityofseveralcountries (Brazil, Cuba, Thailand, etc.). In addition, several developingcountriesarebecominglargeandgrowingnet importers (Egypt, Iran, Korea Rep.), making up for the lack of growth of imports into the industrial countries. Thedevelopingcountries'averageconsumptionis21kg/ personyear,butitishigher(26kg)ifChinaisexcluded - China has only 7 kg as it uses a lot of saccharine. About one half of the developing countries consume lessthan20kg,andaquarterunder10kg.Thescopefor consumptiongrowthisstillconsiderableandtheaverage of the developing countries should keep increasing. China'scontributiontototalgrowthshouldbemorethan in the past since the country could be discouraging the useofsaccharine(seealsoChapter3).

However, empirical evidence suggests that in the countries with high dependence on agriculture, assigning priority to the development of food production holds promise of overcoming the constraint to better nutrition represented by unfavourableoveralleconomicgrowthprospects.This prospectunderliestheprojectionthatthecountrieswith longhistoriesofstagnantfoodconsumptionlevelsand high undernourishment could make some progress in the future. Poor agricultural resources may represent a serious obstacle to such prospects, particularly in countrieswithhighdemographicgrowth.

In conclusion, in many countries, including some of the more populous ones, the relative prevalence of undernourishment (percent of the population) will decline significantly. Fewer countries than at present will have high levels of undernourishment, none of them in the most populous class. The problem of undernourishment will tend to become smaller in terms of both absolute numbers affected and, even more, in relative terms, hence it will become more tractable through policy interventions, both national andinternational.

CHAPTER

Prospects for agriculture and major commodity groups

This Chapter deals with the trends and future outlook of world food and agriculture in terms of the main commodity sectors. A brief introduction to the subject is given first presenting trends and prospects for total agriculture (the aggregates of all crops and livestock products).

3.1 Aggregate agriculture: historical trends and prospects
The historical evidence suggests that the growth of the productivepotentialofglobalagriculturehassofarbeen more than sufficient to meet the growth of effective demand. This is what the long-term term decline in the real price of food suggests (World Bank, 2000). In practice, world agriculture has been operating in a demand-constrained environment.This situation has coexistedwithhundredsofmillionsoftheworldpopulation not having enough food to eat. This situation of un-met demand1co-existingwithactualorpotentialplentyisnot, of course, specific to food and agriculture. It is found in other sectors as well, such as housing, sanitation, health services,etc.

Limitsonthedemandsideatthegloballevelreflected threemainfactors:(a)theslowdowninpopulationgrowth from the late sixties onwards (see Chapter 2); (b) the fact that a growing share of world population has been attainingfairlyhighlevelsofpercapitafoodconsumption, beyond which the scope for further increases is rather limited (Table 2.2), and (c) the fact that those who did nothaveenoughtoeatweretoopoortoaffordmorefood andcauseittobeproduced,ordidnothavetheresources andothermeanstoproduceitthemselves. The first two factors will continue to operate also in the future. Their influence will be expressed as lower growth rates than in the past of demand and, at the global level, also of production. The third factor will also continue to play a role, given that the overall economicoutlookindicatesthatpovertywillcontinueto bewidespreadinthefuture(Table2.6).Itfollowsthatfor arathersignificantpartofworldpopulationthepotential demand for food will not be expressed fully as effective demand.Thus,thepasttrendsofdeceleratinggrowthof demandwilllikelycontinueandperhapsintensify. However, on the production side, there is no assurance that the past experience, when the world's productionpotentialevolvedandprovedtobemorethan

sufficient to meet the growth of demand, will continue, even when demand growth will be much lower than in the past. The natural resources per head of the growing population (e.g. land and water resources per person) will certainly continue to decline and the yield growth potential is more limited than in the past. It remains to be seen whether the advances in technology and related factors (e.g. investment, education, institutions and improved farm management) that underpinned the past growth of production will continue to more than make upforthedecliningresourcesperperson.Thefuturemay bedifferentifwearenownearercriticalthresholds,e.g. yieldceilingsimposedbyplantphysiology,oravailability of water resources for maintaining and/or expanding irrigation. On the positive side, there are those who think that biotechnology has the potential of helping to overcome constraints to further increases in production (Lipton,1999;Evenson,2002). We present in this section a brief overview of what wecanexpectintermsofincreasesofaggregatedemand for,andproductionof,agriculturalproducts.Thefigures we use refer to the aggregate volume of demand and production of the crop and livestock sectors. They are obtainedbymultiplyingphysicalquantitiesofdemandor productiontimespriceforeachcommodityandsumming up over all commodities (each commodity is valued at the same average international price2 in all countries in allyears).Theresultingtimeseriesisanindexofvolume

changesovertimeof aggregatedemandandproduction, when the latter are aggregated as indicated above (see Box 3.1 for more discussion on what these growth rates signify). The movements in this aggregate indicator are rarely sufficient for us to analyze and understand the forces that shape the evolution of agricultural variables intheirdifferentdimensions.Thecommoditiesincluded (see list in the Appendix) are very diverse from the standpoint of what determines their production, demand andtrade.Forthisreason,thesubsequentsectionsofthis Chapter analyze and present the historical experience and prospects of world agriculture in terms of the main commodity sectors. Sections 3.2-3.6 deal with the basic food commodities: cereals, livestock products, oilcrops, thegrouproots,tubersandplantains,andsugar. Theoverallpicturefortotalagricultureispresentedin Table3.1.Attheworldlevel,thegrowthofdemandforall cropandlivestockproductsisprojectedtobelowerthan inthepast,1.5percentp.a.intheperiod1999/01-2030and 0.9 percent for 2030-50 compared with rates in the area 2.1-2.3 percent p.a. in the preceding four decades. The differenceisinpartduetothelowerpopulationgrowthof thefuturecomparedwiththepast.Thiscanbeseenwhen the growth is expressed in terms of demand per capita (middlesectionofTable3.1).Itismainlytheslowdown inthegrowthofdemandinthedevelopingcountries,and in particular in China, that accounts for a large part of the global deceleration.Why this should be so is shown

Box 3.1 Measuring change in agricultural aggregates
When speaking of growth rates of aggregate agricultural production or consumption, it matters what units are used in the measurement of change, in particular whether quantities of the different commodities are just aggregated in physical units (e.g. tonnes ­ which can be done for commodity groups like cereals but not for summing up heterogeneous products such cereals, meat, oranges, pumpkins, coffee, cotton, etc.) or aggregated in terms of value after multiplying each of them by their respective prices (which makes it possible to aggregate them). With shifts in the commodity structure of production and consumption away from staples and towards higher value commodities, the price-based index of the volume of production or consumption grows faster than the aggregate in physical units (e.g. tonnes) or the index obtained when the same quantities are aggregated using as weights their calorie content. For example, China's production of cereals grew in 1991-01 at 0.7 percent p.a., that of meat at 7.3 percent. Both together in tonnage terms grew at 1.5 percent, but they grew at 3.7 percent when aggregated on the basis of their prices ­ given that the price of meat is six times that of cereals in the price weights we use. Therefore, we should be aware that statements like "food production growth exceeded that of population" do not necessarily imply that the quantities available for consumption increased but that the aggregate value of production per capita increased. Similar considerations apply when food consumption quantities are aggregated using their calorie contents as weights. For example, China's food consumption per capita measured by the price-based volume index increased 64 percent in the 1990s but by only 11 percent in terms of calories. Analogous, though less pronounced, developments have characterized food consumption changes in other countries, Brazil among them. In contrast, in countries with little (e.g. India) or virtually no (e.g. sub-Saharan Africa) diet diversification, the volume of consumption has grown at roughly the same rates in both measures.

inthemoredetailedregionalnumbersofTable3.1.They show that the deceleration of the growth of demand per capita in the developing countries outside China is only slight(from0.8-0.9percentp.a.inthepastto0.7percent p.a. in the three decades to 2030), an expected outcome given the operation of the factors mentioned earlier. A better idea about the roles of the above-mentioned factors making for deceleration, in particular the slowdown as higher consumption levels are attained, canbehadfromthedataandprojectionspresentedinthe memo item in Table 3.1. In it the developing countries aregroupedintotwosets:thosethatstartin1999/01with fairlyhighpercapitafoodconsumption(over2700kcal/ person/day) and, therefore, face less scope than before forincreasingconsumption,andalltherest,thatisthose with1999/01kcalunder2700. China carries a large weight in the former group, so its example can be used to illustrate why a drastic decelerationisforeseenforthatgroupandthedeveloping countries as a whole. China has already attained a fairly high level of per capita food consumption of the main commodities,atotalof2960kcal/person/dayin1999/01. In the projections, it increases further to 3300 kcal. This is nearly the level of the industrial countries. The increase of 11 percent in 30 years contrasts with that of 50 percent in the preceding 30 years. This explains the drasticslowdowninthegrowthratewhentheaggregates are measured in terms of calorie content. However, the

trendforconsumptionstructuretochangetowardshigher value products will continue and this will make for the price-based volume of consumption to grow faster (36 percent) than the 11 percent when measured in calories. This 36 percent in the next 30 years is still much lower thanthe170percentincreaseofthepast30years,given thatdietdiversificationtowardsthehigher-valueproducts hasmuchlessscopecomparedwiththepastwhenChina's food consumption was heavily concentrated in cereals and sweet potatoes and had little by way of livestock products. In conclusion, when such deceleration occurs in China and in a few other large developing countries, the whole aggregate of the developing countries, and indeedtheworld,willbeaffecteddownwards. In contrast, the growth of per capita demand in the other developing countries, those with under 2700 kcal/ person/dayin1999/01,isprojectednottodecelerateand actually be higher in the future compared with the past (Table3.1,memoitem).Thisgroupofcountriesincludes India with its one billion population out of the group's 2.3 billion. The prospect that India will not move much towards meat consumption (see section 3.3) contributes to limit the growth rate of total demand for both food and feed. In the past, the aggregate demand of the developingcountrieswasgreatlyinfluencedbytherapid growth of apparent meat consumption in China (see, however,section3.3forpossibleoverestimationofmeat productionandconsumptioninChina).Theprospectthat

thisinfluenceofChinawillbemuchweakerinthefuture andthatitwillnotbereplacedbyasimilarboominother large countries, is one of the major factors making for theprojecteddecelerationintheaggregatedemandofthe developingcountries. At the world level, production equals consumption, sotheprecedingdiscussionaboutglobaldemandgrowth prospects applies also to that of global production. For the individual countries and country groups, however, the two growth rates can differ depending on movements in their net agricultural trade positions. In general,thegrowthratesofproductioninthedeveloping regionshavebeenalittlebelowthoseofdemand,astheir agricultural imports have been growing faster than their exports, leading to gradual erosion of their traditional surplusinagriculturaltrade(cropandlivestockproducts, primaryandprocessed,notincludingfisheryandforestry products).Thetrendhasbeenforthissurplustodiminish and to turn into a net deficit in most years in the 1990s. In the last fifteen years, the net balance reached a peak of US$ 16 billion surplus in 1986 and troughs of US$12billiondeficitsin2000and2001,beforerecovery in the subsequent years to 2004. The recent recovery reflected above all the extraordinary performance of Brazil's exports (mainly oilseeds and livestock products) which generated a net agricultural surplus of US$ 23.6 billion in 2004, up from an average of

US$ 9.2 billion in the late 1990s. Excluding Brazil, the net balance of the other developing countries as a whole continued to precipitate from nearly zero in the late 1980s to reach a deficit of US$ 27 billion in 2004 (Figure 3.1). This prospect had been foreshadowed in our earlier projections to 2010 from base year 1988/90 (Alexandratos,1995,p.121). Behindthesetrendsinthevalueofthenettradebalance of agriculture have been movements in both quantities andpricesofthetradedcommoditiesandthepoliciesthat influenced them. Several factors, often widely differing amongcommodities,playedaroleinthesedevelopments. Thecommoditystructureofthenettradebalancesofthe developingcountriesotherthanBrazilisshowninFigure 3.2.Growingnetimportsofcerealandlivestockproducts have been the dominant elements shaping this deficit, while imports of oilcrops and products by several major developing countries (China, India, Mexico, Pakistan) have also assumed growing importance in shaping the growing deficit of agriculture notwithstanding rapidly risingnetexportsoftheseproductsfromotherdeveloping countries, e.g. Malaysia, Brazil, Argentina, Indonesia (see Table 3.11). On the other side, net exports of fruit and vegetables are virtually the only significant item which has shown consistent improvements.

the early 1990s despite a surge in exports from Brazil, asseveraldevelopingcountriesbecamemajorimporters (Table3.13,Figure3.11).Theshrinkagealsoreflectsthe effectsoftheheavydomesticsupportandtradeprotection in major sugar importing countries like the USA and Japan, or in formerly net importing countries, like the European Union (EU) which became a significant net exporter as a result of these policies. The traditional net surplusofthedevelopingcountriesintropicalbeverages has been fluctuating widely and on balance on a path of slow decline. This has reflected both very slow growth of consumption in the main importing and consuming countries (the industrial ones) and declines in prices, even in current dollars ­ much more in constant dollars. The net result has been that the developing countries have been exporting more and more quantities but their net receipts from such sales have fallen. This is vividly illustrated by the case of coffee (Figure 3.3) where catastrophic price falls characterized the early years of thecurrentdecade. The evolution of the overall net agricultural trade balance of the developing countries as a whole does not by itself denote overall improvement or deterioration from a developmental standpoint. The aggregate of the developing countries is a composite of widely differing countryandcommoditysituations.Forsomecountries,a decliningagriculturaltradebalance(oragrowingdeficit)

is an indicator of progress towards improved welfare. This is the case of countries like Korea, Rep. in which the growing agricultural deficit has gone hand in hand withhighratesofoveralldevelopmentandgrowingfood consumption.Thedecliningoverallbalancealsoreflects the rapid growth in such things as China's growing importsofvegetableoils(apositivedevelopmentoverall as they contribute to improve food consumption and are paid for by growing industrial export earnings); or cotton imports into several developing countries, which sustain their growing exports of textiles. In this latter case,however,thecottonexportingdevelopingcountries are not benefiting much as a growing market share of exportshasbeensuppliedbysubsidizedexportsfromthe USA. Needless to say, a declining agricultural balance isanegativedevelopmentaloutcomeincountrieswhich still depend heavily on export earnings from agriculture and/or have to divert scarce foreign exchange resources topayforgrowingfoodimports(eventuallybuildingup unsustainable foreign debt). It is an even more negative indicator from the standpoint of human welfare when such food imports are not associated with rising food consumption per capita and improved food security, but are necessary just to sustain minimum levels of food consumption-anotuncommonoccurrence. The projections indicate a continuing deepening of the net trade deficit of the developing countries in

35

volume terms. This is because their net imports of the main commodities in which they are deficit, mainly cereals and dairy products, will continue to rise fairly rapidly. In parallel, their net trade surplus in traditional exports (e.g. tropical beverages, bananas) will likely rise less rapidly. The particulars relating to future trade outcomes for the main commodity groups are discussed inthefollowingsectionsofthisChapter.Thepotentialof some developing countries to be growing net exporters of products competing with those from the industrial countries (meat, but also palmoil, soybeans and sugar) in an increasingly liberal trading environment may eventually attenuate the broader trend for developing countries as a whole to become growing net importers of food and agricultural products. Such effects may be further strengthened by the support to the prices of commoditieslikesugarandvegetableoilsiftheiruseas feedstocksfortheproductionofbiofuelsweretobecome morewidespreadfollowingrisingpetroleumprices3. Concerning production, at global level sufficient production potential can be developed for meeting the expected increases in effective demand in the course of the next five decades. As noted, the required growth rate of global production will be lower than in the past. Naturally, even this growth may not materialize unless we make it happen. This requires continued support to agricultural research and policies and other conditions (education,credit,infrastructure,etc.)tomakeitprofitable and possible for farmers to expand production capacity. Thatthereisscopeforincreasingglobalproductionisnot to say that all people will be food-secure in the future. Far from it, as Chapter 2 has shown. The interaction between food security and food production potential is very much a local problem in poor and agriculturedependent societies. Many situations exist where productionpotentialislimited(e.g.inthesemi-aridareas given existing and accessible technology, infrastructure, etc.) and a good part of the population depends on such poor agricultural resources for food and more general livelihood. Unless local agriculture is developed and/or other income earning opportunities open up, the food insecuritydeterminedbylimitedlocalproductionpotential willpersist,eveninthemiddleofpotentialplentyatthe worldlevel.Theneedtodeveloplocalagricultureinsuch situations as the condition sine qua non for improved food security cannot be overemphasized. In Chapter 2

(Box 2.3), we signaled the possibility that some of the moreagriculturallydisadvantagedlow-incomecountries with high population growth may find it extremely difficult to advance by as much as required to improve foodsecuritytoacceptablelevels.

3.2 Cereals
Inour previous work (Bruinsma, 2003) we highlighted the historical experience showing that the growth rate of global demand for cereals (for all uses, hence also of world production) has been in long-term decline. Table 3.2 (column 9) shows the progressive fall in the growth rates in the last 40, 30, 20 and 10 years ending in 2001. ThesetrendsareseenmoreclearlyinFigure3.4usingdata uptothemostrecentyear2005(provisional).Ourearlier projections to 2030 concluded that such deceleration would continue, but that the absolute increases in world consumption in prospect still represented a significant quantum jump of some 965 million tonnes (52 percent) overthebaseyearlevelof1997/99,leadingtototalworld consumptionof2830milliontonnesby2030. There are a number of factors suggesting that the deceleration may be even more pronounced than visualized only 4 years ago and the absolute increments willlikelybesmaller.Theyarethefollowing: n Datarevisionsshowingthatworldconsumptioninour old base year 1997/99 was lower than we knew then ­by25milliontonnes;

12.3 percent. For the world as a whole, cereals production remained practically flat at around 1.9 billion tonnes for the period 1996-2003. These recent developments, if taken into account, as they should to the extent that they are relevant for the future, represent another major factor making for lowerworldproduction/consumptioninthefuture. The resulting lower projection of world cereals consumptionfor2030is2680milliontonnes,agrowthrate of1.2percentp.a.measuredfromtheaverageof1999/01. This is higher than that of the 1990s (0.9 percent), when per capita consumption (all uses) fell by 20 kg or 6percent(seeTable3.2,Col.2),principallybecausethe last decade was the period of the drastic decline in the transition countries following the systemic reforms.The 2030 figure for the developing countries is 1800 million tonnes, which is some 120 million tonnes lower than in our earlier projections. The reduction reflects the three factors mentioned above. For the rest of the developing countries(i.e.excludingChinaandIndia,andinpercapita terms),projected2030consumptionof268kgisactually slightlyhigherthanthatofourearlierprojections. Looking beyond 2030, the growth rate of world consumption and production is expected to fall further in the subsequent 20 years to 0.6 percent p.a. and the

aggregate consumption would rise to just over 3 billion tonnesby2050.Thus,annualworldproductionmustrise bysome800milliontonnesinthe30yearsto2030(not much above the some 770 million tonnes it rose in the preceding 30 years 1969/71 - 1999/01) and by another 330milliontonnesinthesubsequenttwodecades.From the standpoint of mounting pressures on land and water resources,thesenumbersimplyamuchmoremanageable outcome than previously thought. The slowdown in the growth of world consumption is, however, a very mixed blessing. On the positive side we must count the influence of the lower population growth and the gradual approaching of saturation levels in per capita foodconsumptioninagrowingnumberofcountries.On the negative side is the prospect that there will still be countries with persistent low overall food consumption levels whose population would consume more if they hadaccesstomorefood.

Box 3.2

Uncertainties concerning China's cereals consumption and stocks

Data revisions and the lower projected population growth account for the bulk of the difference between the current projections of cereals consumption in the developing countries and those of the earlier study. In addition lower projections for China also contribute to the difference. China's production of cereals (aggregate of wheat, maize, barley and milled rice ­ minor cereals are not included in order to make the data comparable with those of FAPRI) peaked in 1998 and 1999 at 380 million tonnes. Thereafter, it fell more or less continuously in the next five years reaching 312 million tonnes in 2003, before rebounding to around 345 million tonnes in 2004 and a provisional estimate of 352 million tonnes in 2005. Notwithstanding these declines in production, domestic prices did not rise until about mid-2003 and China remained a net cereals exporter (maize, rice) up to 2003 (it became a small net importer of 5 million tonnes in 2004). By mid-2003, however, the production shortfalls in combination with rising grain prices in world markets made an impact on the domestic demand-supply balance and led to rapidly increasing grain prices. The production rebound in 2004 is attributed to the response of farmers to these price rises as well as to good weather. The important thing is to know what happened to consumption of food and feed and whether any significant departures from past patterns are indicative of more fundamental structural changes likely to persist in the future and affect the projections. FAO's Food Balance Sheets data (which are used in this study) suggest that total domestic use of these cereals also fell continuously from a peak of 372 million tonnes in 1996 to 306 million tonnes in 2003 (the last year for which such FBS data are available as of March 2006). These trends are shown in Figure 3.5. However, others consider that total domestic use did not decline but that the shortfall was made up by drawing down China's huge stocks. According to the data used by FAPRI (2005), stocks were reduced from a huge 325 million tonnes in 1999 to 106 million tonnes in 2004 (Figure 3.5). A review of the subject undertaken by FAO highlights the uncertainties concerning both stocks and consumption trends and concludes that "stocks in China must have fallen substantially in recent years" (FAO, 2004c). The fact that livestock production growth (which depends increasingly on cereals feed) continued unabated in this period (meat production increased 51 percent) would seem to suggest that the second view could be nearer the truth. However, there are two counterarguments: (a) over the same period apparent consumption of protein feeds (mainly soybean meal) seems to have grown very rapidly judging from the increase in soybeans availability from 15 million tonnes to 36 million tonnes, with all of the increase coming from imports. This suggests substitution of oilmeals for cereals in the feed rations; and (b) we should not take for granted the livestock production statistics, as it is widely held that they overstate the growth of livestock production (see Ma et al, 2004). In short, the reliability of livestock data is as doubtful as that of changes in cereals consumption, if not more. Such limitations make them a poor guide for resolving the uncertainties as to what happened to the feed consumption of cereals. And, of course, the greater part of the decline in cereals use in the FBS data originated in food (35 million tonnes), not in feed (20 million tonnes). This lends some degree of plausibility to the decline in cereals consumption (see Box 2.1).

decadeorso(seeFigure3.6andTable3.4).Thistrendhas been most evident in several countries ofAsia, both East AsiaandSouthAsia.Intheformer,percapitaconsumption of rice declined from a peak of 122 kg in 1984 to 114 kg in 2001. In the latter, it declined from a peak of 89 kg in 1991 to 83 kg ten years later. Given the overwhelming weight of these regions in world rice consumption, these declinesarereflectedintheaggregatetrendsoftheworld and the developing countries. These trends are projected to continue and the average of the developing countries may fall further. In contrast, per capita consumption in the developing countries of both wheat (mainly food) and coarse grains(increasinglyforanimalfeed)should continueincreasing(Table3.4,Col.4).

Concerningwheat,thegrowthofconsumptioninthe greatmajorityofthedevelopingcountrieshasdepended greatlyonthegrowthofimports:ifweexcludeArgentina (the major traditional net exporter of wheat among the developing countries) and the two giants China and India from the developing country totals, net imports of the rest increased from 20 million tonnes in 1969/71 to 75 million tonnes in 1999/01, when their consumption grewfrom62milliontonnesto155milliontonnes.That is, some 60 percent of the increment in consumption was met by increments in imports. And, of course, several countries have depended entirely on imports for increasingconsumptionofwheat.Theseincludeboththe many tropical non-producing countries as well as those

facing increasingly binding land and water constraints to increasing production (e.g. Yemen). Growth in per capita wheat consumption of the developing countries should resume, following the exhaustion of the "China effect" (see Box 3.2) which had led to falls in the average of the developing countries in the 1990s. The past pattern of dependence of the growth of consumption on growing imports would continue. Thus,

for the same group of developing countries mentioned above (developing excluding Argentina, China and India), some 50 percent of the increment in their projected consumption should be met by increases in imports. Overall, the net wheat imports of all the developing countries except Argentina could grow from the present 74 million tonnes to 150 million tonnes in 2030 and on to 190 million tonnes in 2050. These substantial increases

The next three decades will probably see a higher increase in the global totals than the preceding three decades which witnessed the drastic contraction of feed use in the formerly centrally planned economies of Europe.

The relevant data are depicted in Figure 3.7. It is seen that the developing countries will increase their share in worldnon-foodconsumptionofcoarsegrainsandsurpass the rest of the world by 2030. They now account for 39percentoftheworldnon-fooduseofcoarsegrains,up from only 17 percent three decades ago. The share may increaseto52in2030andonto56percentin2050.

Imports and Exports
Thelowerprojecteddemandforcerealsinthedeveloping countries discussed above will also influence their import demand which, although continuing to grow, it should lead to somewhat lower net imports in 2030 (230 million tonnes rather than the 265 million tonnes we had earlier) and on to some 300 million tonnes in 20504(Table3.2,dataandprojectionsfortheindividual developing regions are in Table 3.3). This is a just over doubling of net imports in the next three decades compared with the 5.7-fold increase of the preceding three decades. However, the growth of net imports has been slowing down, and the just over doubling over the next three decades represents some recovery in the growth of net imports. This outcome reflects above all the prospect that countries like India and China, which in recent years reduced net imports and became modest net exporters, will eventually revert to net importer status(Figure3.8). Producing the export surplus.Toexplorehowthese growingimportrequirementsofthedevelopingcountries maybematchedbyincreasesonthepartoftheexporters we need some rearrangement and more detailed setting outofthedataandprojections.ThisisattemptedinTable 3.6.Thefollowingcommentsrefermainlytothecontents ofthistable. The net imports of the developing importers (shown atthebottomofTable3.5andrepeatedinTable3.6)plus those of the traditional industrial country net importers (essentially Japan, Israel, and the other industrial countries except the EU, North America and Australia) went from 47 million tonnes in 1969/71 to 177 million tonnes in 1999/01, an increment of 130 million tonnes in three decades. It was met by increases of the net trade balances of the following country groups which were traditional exporters or became such during that

period:theEU-1546milliontonnes(fromnetimportsof 21 million tonnes to net exports of 25 million tonnes), North America 50 million tonnes, Australia 12 million tonnes, combined Argentina, Thailand and Viet Nam 20milliontonnes. In the projections, the net import requirements of the developing importers and the industrial importers increase by 155 million tonnes to 2030 and by another 84 million tonnes by 2050. These quantities must be generated as additional export surplus by the rest of the world.Wherewilltheycomefrom?Thenovelelementin the projections is that part of the required increase may comefromthetransitioncountries,whiletherestshould come from the traditional exporters, developing ones - mainlyArgentina, Thailand and Vietnam ­ and, in time honoured fashion, the lion's share of the additional net exportswouldoriginateinthetraditionalindustrialgrain exporting countries - NorthAmerica,Australia and, but onadecliningpathasnetexporter,alsotheEU(European Commission,2005b). The prospective role of the transition countries as a noveladditionalsourceofgrainexportstotherestofthe world must be underlined in any debate on the potential of world agriculture to meet the growing demand of the developing countries. These countries as a group had becomelargenetimportersfromaboutthemid-70suntil the early 1990s, with their net imports having reached 43milliontonnesin1993.Followingthereformprocess they emerged as net exporters in most years after the mid-90s, reaching peak net exports of 31 million tonnes in 2002, following the extraordinary weather-induced reduction of harvests in Western Europe. The shift of the transition countries from large net importers to net exporters and the prospect that they will be growing net exporters in the future are clearly seen in Figure 3.8. These prospective developments should help relax often expressed concerns that the traditional industrial exporters of cereals would find it difficult to increase export surpluses in pace with the growing import requirements of the developing country importers. In practice, and given the little scope for increases in their domestic consumption, the production of cereals in the traditional industrial exporter need only increase at rates that will be lower than in the past (see Table 3.6, bottomrow).

4 It is noted that our projections made in the mid-eighties from base year 1982/84, when net imports of the developing countries were 72 mt, indicated

that they could rise to 112 million by 2000 (Alexandratos, 1988, p. 106), which is precisely the actual outcome for 1999/01 (Table 3.5), no doubt a lucky coincidence.

Livestock commodities

Past and present
Livestock, a major factor in the growth of world agriculture.Theworldfoodeconomyisbeingincreasingly driven by the shift of diets and food consumption patterns towards livestock products. Some use the term "food revolution" to refer to these trends (Delgado et al., 1999). In the developing countries, where almost all world population increases take place, consumption of meat has been growing at over 5 percent p.a., that of milk and dairy products at 3.5 ­ 4.0 percent p.a. in the last few decades.Aggregate agricultural output is being affected by these trends, not only through the growth of livestock production proper, but also through the linkagesoflivestockproductiontothecropsectorwhich supplies the feeding stuffs, mainly cereals and oilseeds. In addition, the shift of aggregate agricultural output towards the higher-value livestock products makes the growthrateofagriculturetobehigherthanwouldresult fromamereaggregationoftonnesorcalorieequivalents (Box3.1). On the negative side, and in association with policy distortions or market failures, there are environmental implications associated with the expansion of livestock production. For example, through the expansion of land

for livestock development, livestock sector growth has beenaprimeforceindeforestationinsomecountriessuch asBrazil,andinovergrazinginothercountries.Intensive livestock operations on industrial scale, mostly in the industrial countries but increasingly in the developing ones, are a major source of environmental problems through the production of point-source pollution (effluents, etc.). In parallel, growth in the ruminant sector contributes to greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere through methane emissions and nitrous oxidefromthewasteofgrazinganimals. Important exceptions and qualifications.Thestrength of the livestock sector as the major driving force of global agriculture can be easily exaggerated. Many developing countries and regions, where the need to increase protein consumption is the greatest, are not participating in the process. There are 26 developing countries having under 10 kg per capita consumption of meat and another 30 with between 10 and 20 kg (the industrial countries have an average of 90 kg). Of these 56countries23havecurrentlyconsumptionlevelslower than 10 years earlier. Therefore, the phenomenon of risingmeatconsumptionintheworldislesswidespread than first impressions from the aggregates would lead one to believe. It is just that per capita consumption has been growing rapidly in a number of large countries, China and Brazil among them, and this has pulled up

45

the average of the developing countries and the world (seeTables 2.7 and 2.8 and discussion in Chapter 2).As noted (Box 3.2), China's meat production statistics are thought to overstate the real growth of the sector in this country,hencealsooftheworld.Thus,thegrowthrateof worldmeatconsumptionof2.7percentp.a.inthe1990s ishalvedifChinaisexcludedfromtheworldtotals.This isnottodenythatmeatandotherlivestockproductsare preferredfoodsinmostcountriesandthatdemandgrows rapidlywhenincomesincrease.Itisjustthatthereisless of a meat revolution than commonly asserted, mainly because of lack of development and income growth in many countries. In addition, cultural and religious factors have also stood in the way of wider diffusion of consumptionofmeatingeneralinsomecountries(India) orofparticularmeats(beefinIndia,porkintheMuslim countries). Formilkanddairyproducts,therehasbeenno`China effect' on the world totals, given the small weight of these products in China's food consumption, no matter thatitspercapitaconsumptiongrewrapidlyfromasmall base and it doubled in the last decade to some 10 kg. There has, however, been a strong negative impact on the growth of world consumption from the slump in the transition countries in the 1990s which reduced the growth rate from 2.0 percent p.a. (world without the transitioncountries)to1.0percent(worldtotal). Rapid growth of the poultry sector. Perhaps the perception of revolutionary change in the meat sector reflects the extraordinary performance of world production and consumption of poultry meat. It has been growing at more than 5 percent p.a. (Table 3.7) and its share in world meat production increased from 15 percent three decades ago to 30 percent currently. Per capita consumption increased nearly three-fold over the same period. That of pork also increased from 9.7kgto14.7kg(China'sstatisticshelping,buthardly atallfortheworldwithoutChina).Incontrast,percapita consumption of ruminant meat (from cattle, sheep and goats) actually declined a little. The growth of poultry meatconsumptionreflectedinpartsubstitutionforother meats, essentially beef, in the countries with already medium-high levels of total meat consumption, e.g. several major producers and often exporters of beef in LatinAmerica,NorthAmerica,OceaniaandtheEU.For other countries, it was part of the more general thrust towards rapidly growing consumption of meat, e.g. severalcountriesintheregionsEastAsiaandNearEast/ NorthAfrica. Significant increases in beef consumption

wererare.TheyoccurredinKoreaRep.,Japan,Malaysia, Kuwait,SaudiArabia,Mexico,TaiwanProvinceofChina, (all of them somehow linked to increased beef imports, oftentheresultofmoreliberaltradepolicies),andChina. Brazil is an example of fast growth in all aspects of the meat economy, with significant increases in production, consumptionandexportsofbeef,poultryandpork. Buoyancy of meat trade in recent years. The rapid growthinconsumptionofseveralcountrieswassupported by even faster growth in trade. Some drastic changes occurred in the sources of exports and destination of imports. For example, Japan increased per capita meat consumptionfrom29kgin1979/81to43kgin1999/01, an increase of 2.1 million tonnes. All this increase was met by imports (which grew more than 5-fold over the period), while production remained essentially constant. At the global level, trade (world exports, including the meat equivalent of live animal exports) increased from 9.2 percent of world consumption in 1979/81 to 12.8 percent in 1999/01, with poultry increasing from 7 percent to 14 percent, beef from 12.5 percent to 16percentandporkfrom6.5to10percent.Themajor actors on the side of the importers include Japan which topsthelist,followedbytheRussianFederation,Mexico, Hong Kong (China SAR), SaudiArabia and the Rep. of Korea.Ontheexportside,thecombinedexportsofbeef and mutton of Australia and New Zealand put them at the top of world meat exporters until 2001, when Brazil becametheworld'slargestexporter.Brazil'sskyrocketing exportsledtothedevelopingcountriesasawholeturning intonetexportersofmeatin2004forthefirsttimesince thelate1970s.Theothermajordevelopmentofthe1990s has been the turn around of the USA from a sizeable net importer of meat to a sizeable net exporter, a result reflecting its declining net imports of beef and pigmeat and skyrocketing exports of poultry meat. In a sense, though the policies are different, the USA is replicating theearlierexperienceoftheEU,whichturnedfromabig net importer of meat up to the late 1970s to a large and, until1999,growingnetexporter. Figure 3.9 shows the net trade balances of meat by major country groups. On the importer side the lion's share is accounted for by Japan (net imports of 2750 thousand tonnes in 1999/01), while an equal amount is accounted for by a few developing countries (major developing importers in the figure, i.e. those with over 100 thousand tonnes net imports in 1999/01: Mexico, Hong Kong, Korea Rep., Philippines, Taiwan, Malaysia, and Cuba), followed by the region Near

thatofmeat.Inpractice,theworldpercapitaconsumption is currently not much above that of 10 or 20 years ago. This is explained in large part by the decline in the transition countries. Such declines affected much more the world milk sector than that of meat, because these countries at the inception of the declines had a much larger weight in world milk output (27 percent) than in that of meat (17 percent). The growth rate of world consumptioninthe1990swasonly1percentp.a.,butit was2.1percentp.a.fortheworldwithoutthetransition countries. The developing countries continue to have percapitaconsumptionwellbelowthatoftheindustrial countries(partlyreflectingtheconsumptionhabitsofEast Asia as well as low incomes and poverty in many other countries),buttheyaregraduallyreducingthedistance, although not all countries/regions are participating in these increases (Tables 2.7 and 2.8). Consumption in South Asia grew the fastest and accounts for a good partofthegainsinthedevelopingcountries(Table3.8). Per capita consumption declined in both sub-Saharan Africa and the Near East/North Africa regions from the early 1980s onwards. This development is partly associated with the levelling off in the eighties and subsequent reduction of subsidized exports from the EU. The near stationary net imports of the developing countrieslargelyparallelthepatternofnetexportsfrom theEU(Figure3.10)

The livestock sector in the future
Slower growth in world meat consumption. The forces that shaped the rapid growth of meat demand in the past are expected to weaken considerably in the future. Slower population growth compared with the past is an important factor. Perhaps more important is the natural deceleration of growth because fairly high consumption levels have already been attained in the few major countries that dominated past increases. As noted, China went from 13 kg 20 years ago to 48 kg currently, according to its statistics. If it were to continue at the same rate, it would soon surpass the industrial countries in per capita consumption of meat, an unreasonable prospect given that China will still be a middle income country with significant parts of its population rural and in the low-income category for some time to come. As anotherexampleandforsimilarreasons,Brazil'scurrent average meat consumption of 79 kg suggests that the scopeisratherlimitedfortherapidincreasesofthepast tocontinueunabatedthroughthecomingdecades. Thenextquestioniswhetheranynewmajordeveloping countries with presently low meat consumption will emergeasmajorgrowthpolesintheworldmeateconomy. India with its huge population and very low meat consumption could in theory dominate developments if it shifted massively to consuming meat. It is recalled

The recent high growth ratesofproduction(10percentp.a.inthe1990s)andper capita consumption of poultry meat in India are likely to continue unabated in the coming decades. That is, India's participation in the global upsurge of the poultry sector,beingatitsincipientstage,hasstillalongwayto go6. Consumption of other meats will probably grow by much less, with beef and pork being subject to cultural constraints for significant parts of the population of India and indeed the whole of South Asia. In parallel,

consumption of the preferred mutton/goat meat faces production constraints, implying rising real relative prices compared with poultry meat (Landes et al., 2004). Overall, the force of the growth of poultry meat consumption has the potential of raising India's average consumption of all meat to more than double present levels by 2030 and more by 2050. Notwithstanding the possibility that this kind of growth will perhaps be viewedasrevolutionaryinanationalcontext,Indiawould still be for several decades a predominantly vegetarian society by international standards7. Such increases in India'slivestocksectorwillbefarfromhavinganimpact onworldaveragesandthoseofthedevelopingcountries anywhere near that which was exerted in the historical periodbydevelopmentsinChina. Inconclusion,thepercapitameatconsumptioninthe developing countries is likely to grow at much slower ratesthaninthepast,mainlybecausethegreatpushgiven to consumption growth in the past by China and Brazil willnotbeplayingthesameroleinthefuture.Theresult isthattheaggregatemeatconsumptionofthedeveloping maygrowinthenextthirtyyearshalfasrapidlyasinthe precedingthreedecades(Table3.7).However,percapita

consumption in the rest of the developing countries should continue rising and even accelerate, as shown in Table2.7. Percapitameatconsumptioninthe transition countries has already started recovering from its precipitous fall in the 1990s (having fallen from 71 kg in 1989/91 to 44kgin1999/01).Itmayeventuallyrevertby2050tothe high levels it had achieved before the systemic reforms of the 1990s (Table 2.7). In the industrial countries,per capitaconsumptionofmeatisfairlyhighat90kg.Afew countries with high fish consumption (Japan, Norway) have much lower, though rising, levels. In principle, the

achievement of near-saturation levels of overall food consumption, as well as concerns about health, suggest that there is little scope for further increases. Yet the data indicate that such increases do take place even in countries which have passed the 100-kg mark, probably reflecting a mix of overconsumption and growing postretail waste or feeding of pets. For example, the USA increasedconsumptionbysome10kg(to121kg)inthe last ten years and the latest FAPRI projections foresee an increase (all of it in poultry meat) of 7 percent from the average of 1999/01 to 2014, (FAPRI, 2005). The latest USDA baseline projections to 2015 provide a

50

largely similar outlook (slight decline in beef and pork, increase in poultry - USDA, 2006: Table 21). The latest projections of the EU foresee a 6-kg increase in the 10 new member states (to 82 kg by 2012), while per capita consumption should remain stable at 90 kg in the EU-158. (European Commission, 2005b, Table A13). These trends have to be taken into account, even if nutritional and health considerations would suggest otherwise. As shown in Table 2.7, our projection of per capita meat consumption in the industrial countries grows10percentinthethreedecadesto2030andanother 4percentinthesubsequenttwodecadesto2050. In conclusion, the projected slowdown in the world meat economy is based on the following assumptions: (a) relatively modest further increases in per capita consumptionintheindustrialcountries,(b)growthrates inpercapitaconsumptioninChinaandBrazilwellbelow those of the past, (c) persistence of relatively low levels ofpercapitaconsumptioninIndia,and(d)persistenceof lowincomesandpovertyinmanydevelopingcountries. If these assumptions are accepted, the projected slowdownfollowsinevitably.Naturally,aslowergrowth rate applied to a large base year world consumption (228 million tonnes in 1999/01) will still produce large absolute increases (some 465 million tonnes must be producedannuallyby2050,thegreatbulkofwhichinthe developing countries). These quantitative increases will accentuateenvironmentalandotherproblemsassociated withsuchlargelivestocksectors. No slowdown in the consumption of dairy products. Giventhestilllowconsumptionlevelsinthedeveloping countries,thepotentialforgrowthisthere.Fewdeveloping countries have per capita consumption exceeding 150 kg (Argentina, Uruguay, some pastoral countries in the Sudano-Sahelian zone of Africa). Among the most populous countries, only Pakistan has such a level. In SouthAsia, where milk and dairy products are preferred foods, India has only 64 kg and Bangladesh 14 kg. East Asia has only 11 kg. In this latter region, however, food consumption preferences do not favour milk and dairy products, but the potential for growth is still there with growingurbanization.Theregion'spercapitaconsumption has been rising fast and should continue to do so (Table 2.8). Overall, therefore, there is considerable scope for furthergrowthinconsumptionofmilkanddairyproducts. Intheprojections,thegrowthrateofworldconsumptionis higherthanintherecentpastdespitethelowerpopulation

growth (Table 3.8), an outcome reflecting above all the reversalofdeclinesinthetransitioncountries. Meat trade expansion will likely continue, but more of the imports may be supplied by the developing exporters: Despitetheprojectedslowdowninmeatdemandgrowth, some of the forces that made for the above discussed buoyancyinworldmeattradeintherecentpastarelikely tocontinuetooperate.Thenettradepositionsareshown in Figure 3.9. Overall, the trend for the developing countries to become growing net importers of meat (1680 thousand tonnes in 1999/01, compared with net exportsof1100thousandtonnesthreedecadesago)may notcontinue,mainlybecausethegroupofthedeveloping netexporterslistedearlier,foremostamongthemBrazil, havethepotentialtocontinueincreasingexports. Tradeindairyproductswillalsolikelyrecover,with the net imports of the developing countries resuming growth after a period of stagnation from the mid-80s onwards (Table 3.8). This would reflect continuation of the growth of imports of East Asia, as well as the resumption of import growth into the major deficit region, the Near East/North Africa, following recovery inthegrowthofdemand. Livestock Production and the Use of Cereals for Animal Feed. We referred earlier to the importance of the livestock sector in creating demand for grains and oilseeds. Estimates put the total feed use of cereals at 666 million tonnes, or 35 percent of world total cereal use. Feed demand for cereals is often considered as the dynamic element that conditions the growth of the cereals sector. However, in the last two decades or so it has not been dynamic at all. Feed use of cereals grew 2.4percentp.a.inthe1970s(whenlivestockproduction was growing at 2.5 percent), but then the growth rate fell to 0.9 percent in the subsequent two decades while world livestock production kept growing at over 2.0percentp.a. It appears, therefore, that the world has been getting ontheaveragemoremeat,milkandeggsperkgofcereals used as feed, a prima faciecaseofproductivitygainsin livestockproduction.Nodoubt,therehavebeensuchgains reflectinginparttheabovementionedgrowingshareofthe poultry sector in total meat production (poultry requires much smaller quantities of cereals feed per kg of meat than beef).

of the regions that use grain-intensive feeding systems to the developing countries that have lower grain/meat ratios on average.The developing countries account now for 55 percent of world meat output, up from 34 percent two decades ago. The relative shift in the geographical distribution of world meat output reflected not only their faster growth of consumption but also the drastic decline inthe1990sintheoutputofthetransitioncountrieswhich had high and often inefficient use of cereals feed per unit ofoutput. Otherfactorsthatcontributedtothesetrendsinclude thehighcerealssupportpricesintheEUwhichprovided incentives to livestock producers to substitute others feeds for cereals, including imported oilmeals and cassava. Cereals feed use in the EU15 peaked at about 1980, remained nearly flat until the mid-eighties, and declined continuously until 1992, when the MacSharry reformoftheEU'sCommonAgriculturalPolicyreduced domesticcerealpricesandthelivestocksectorhassince increased feed use (by 50 percent in the ten years after 1992).This boost to feeddemandfrom the lower policy prices of cereals has largely run its course and growth will much weaker in the future (European Commission, 2005b). Then in the second half of the 1990s the above described decline in cereals use in China set in and this wasanotherimportantfactorleadingtothecurrent"low" share of feed in the aggregate cereals use in the world (35percent,downfrom40percenttwodecadesearlier). Finally, the slow growth of cereals feed use reflected also the growing use of oilmeals in livestock feeding. World output of soybeans, which is mainly processed into oil and high protein oilmeal, grew at 5 percent p.a. in the last decade. By implication so has the production and consumption as feed of soybean meal. This implies a relative increase in the feed rations of oilmeals at the expenseofcereals. Concerningthefuture,someoftheforcesresponsible for the slowdown in the demand for cereals feed have beenexhaustedand,therefore,willnothaveadepressing influenceinthefuture.Asnoted,thedeclineincerealsfeed use in the EU was reversed already from the early 1990s and such use should keep growing, albeitatmuchslower ratesthanintheperiodafterthepricereforms.Inparallel, the declines in the Transition countries of both livestock production and cereals feed use have levelled off in the last couple of years and such use will revert to growing again. The increase of the share of poultry in total meat

productionwillcontinue,butitwillnotbeaspronounced as in the past and the implicit productivity gains (viewed attheleveloftheentirelivestocksector)fromthissource will not be as pronounced as in the past. Then China's decline in feed use of cereals cannot continue for much longeriflivestockproductiongrowthistoproceedevenat muchlowergrowthratesthaninthepast. We noted earlier that the relative shift of world livestock output from the developed to the developing countriescontributedtothedeclineinthegrowthofcereals feedusetowellbelowthegrowthoflivestockproduction. It is possible to visualize that this same phenomenon could work in the opposite direction in the future: the continued growth of the developing countries' share in world livestock output will be associated with a gradual shift of their production from grazing and `backyard' systems to stall-fed systems using concentrate feedstuffs. Thiswillbeanadditionalfactormakingforhighergrowth thaninthepastinthefeeduseofcereals.Suchstructural change in the production systems will tend to raise the average grain-meat ratios of the developing countries and perhaps compensate for opposite trends resulting fromimprovementsinproductivity.Astrongcaseforthis prospectismadeinarecentanalysisbytheDutchCentre forWorldFoodStudies(Keyzeret al.,2001). In conclusion, all these deviations from past trends suggest that the growth of feed demand for cereals should in the future be more in unison with the growth of livestock production. This is what we have projected with the result that the past declines in the growth of demand for cereals for feed should be reversed and the growthrateto2030isprojectedtobe1.6percentp.a.(up from0.8percentp.a.inthe1990s)and0.8percentp.a.in thesubsequenttwodecades(Table3.7).

even that of livestock products. The major driving force on the demand side has been the growth of food consumption in developing countries, mostly in the form of oil but also direct consumption of soybeans, groundnuts, etc., as well as in the form of derived productsotherthanoil.Fooddemandinthedeveloping countriesaccountedforonehalfoftheincreasesinworld output of the last two decades, with output measured in oil content equivalent (Table 3.10). China, India and a fewothercountriesrepresentedthebulkofthisincrease. No doubt, the strong growth of demand for protein products for animal feed was also a major supporting factor in the buoyancy of the oilcrops sector. The rapid growth of the oilcrops sector reflects the synergy of the two fastest rising components of the demand for food -fooddemandforoilsfavouringalloilcropsthathadthe potential for rapid expansion of production, e.g. the oil palm,andthatforlivestockproductsfavouringoilcrops with high protein oilmeals for feed, e.g. soybeans (see below). The oilpalm and soybeans provided 57 percent of the total increment in world oilcrop productioninthelasttwodecades(Table3.10). Growing contribution to food supplies and food security. World production, consumption and trade in

this sector have been increasingly dominated by a small number of crops (soybeans, oil palm, sunflower, and rapeseed) and countries. However, the more traditional and less glamorous oilcrops continue to be very importantasmajorelementsinthefoodsupplyandfood securitysituationinmanycountries,e.g.groundnutsand sesameseedintheSudanandMyanmar,coconutsinthe PhilippinesandSriLanka,oliveoilintheMediterranean countries, cottonneseed oil in the countries of Central AsiaandthoseintheSahel,etc. Rapid growth of food demand in the developing countries, in conjunction with the high calorie content of oil products, have been a major component of the increases achieved in food consumption (kcal/person/ day)inthesecountries.AsnotedinChapter2,thistrend is set to continue, as vegetable oils still have significant scope for consumption increases in most developing countries. Non-food uses. The second major driving force on the demand side has been the non-food industrial use of vegetable oils, with China and the EU being major contributors to this growth (Table 3.10). In terms of actualoilproducedandused(ratherthanofoilequivalent of oilcrops) the world is apparently using some

25 million tonnes for non-food industrial uses out of a total use of 91 million tonnes. Two decades earlier, the comparable figures were 8 and 41 million tonnes, respectively. The existing data do not permit us to draw even a partial balance sheet of the non-food industrial products for which significant quantities of vegetable oil products are used as inputs10. The main industrial products involved (paints, detergents, lubricants, oleochemicalsingeneraland,increasingly,biodiesel)are commoditiesforwhichworlddemandcanbeexpectedto growmuchfasterthanthedemandforfood.Ifpetroleum pricesremainedhigh,thebiofuelssectorwilllikelykeep growing in importance as a market outlet for oils and fats, just as the growing market for bioethanol provides outlets for sugar cane (mainly in Brazil), maize (mainly intheUSA)andtoamuchsmallerextentforothercrops (sugar beet, wheat, sorghum, eventually cassava, etc). The EU has a target of achieving a 5.75 percent market share of biofuels in the petrol and diesel market in 2010 (EuropeanCommission,2005c:38). Concentration of growth in a small number of crops and countries. Thedemandforproteinmealsfor animalfeedalsocontributedtochangethegeographical distribution of oilseeds production. The latter shifted towards countries that could produce and export oilseeds of high protein content, in which oilmeals are not by-products but rather joint products with oil, e.g. soybeans in South America. In addition, support policies of the European Union (EU) also helped to

Prospects for agriculture and major commodity groups

net trade surplus of the vegetable oils/oilseeds complex (oils,oilmeals,oilseeds)ofthedevelopingcountrieswas progressively reduced and turned into a deficit in 2001 (it recovered back to positive in the subsequent three years 2002-4). This happened despite the spectacular growth of exports of a few developing countries that cametodominatetheworldexportscene,viz.Malaysia andIndonesiaforpalmoilandBrazilandArgentinafor soybeans. Indeed, if Brazil is excluded from the totals, the deficit of the rest of the developing countries kept growingtoreachUS$9.4billionin2004(Figure3.2).As happenedwiththelivestocksector,theoverallevolution

of trade of oilseeds and products has contributed to the agricultural trade balance of the developing countries diminishingrapidlyandturningnegative(Figure3.1). Oilcrops responsible for a good part of agricultural land expansion.Ontheproductionside,thefastgrowth of oilcrops expanded mainly, though not exclusively, in land-abundant countries (Brazil, Argentina, Indonesia, Malaysia, the USA, Canada). The oil palm and the three annual oilcrops which grew the fastest (soybeans, rapeseed, and sunflower) have been responsible for a good part of the expansion of cultivated land under all crops in the developing countries and the world as

a whole. In the developing countries, the harvested area11 under the main crops (cereals, roots and tubers, pulses, fibres, sugar crops and oilcrops) expanded by 96millionhawhilethatintherestoftheworlddeclined by65millionhainthetwodecadesto2000,ofwhich morethanonehalf(50millionha)wasforoilcrops. These numbers clearly demonstrate that land expansion continues to play an important role in the growth of crop production. The 160 percent increaseinoilcropoutputbetween1979/81and1999/01 in the developing countries was brought about by a 62 percent (50 million ha) expansion of land under these crops, at the same time as land under their other crops also increased by an almost equal amount (47millionha).

The oilcrops sector in the future
Food demand.As noted, the growth of food demand inthedevelopingcountrieswasthemajordrivingforce behind the rapid growth of the oilcrops sector in the historical period. The most populous countries played a major role in these developments (Table 3.10). Will these trends continue in the future? In the first place, slowerpopulationgrowth,particularlyinthedeveloping countries, will be reflected in slower growth rates of their aggregate demand for food, ceteris paribus. Naturally,othersthingswillnotbeequal:inparticular, the per capita consumption of the developing countries was only 4.9 kg three decades ago.This afforded great scopefortheincreasesinconsumptionwhichtookplace.

11 The increase of harvested area implies not only expansion of the cultivated land in a physical sense (also referred to as arable area in the original study  ­Bruinsma,2003)butalsoexpansionofthelandundermultiplecropping(intheharvestedorsownareadefinition,ahectareofarablelandiscounted as two if it is cropped twice in a year). Therefore, the harvested area expansion under the different crops discussed here could overstate the extent to which physical area in cultivation has increased. This overstatement is likely to be more pronounced for cereals (where the arable area has probably declined even in the developing countries) than for oilcrops, as the latter include also tree crops (oil and coconut palms, olive trees).

Prospects for agriculture and major commodity groups

However,intheprocesspercapitaconsumptiongrewto 10.4 kg in 1999/01.Within this average, India doubled its per capita consumption and China increased it 3.5-fold. As shown in Table 3.10, food demand in these two countries accounted for over one half of the increment in the food demand of the developing countries.Whileoilswillremainafooditemwithhigh income elasticity in most developing countries in the short and medium term-future, the higher levels that will be achieved gradually will lead to slower growth inthelongertermfuture.Thus,percapitaconsumption willlikelyriseatmuchslowerratescomparedwiththe past (Tables 2.7-2.8). This slowdown must be seen in the context of rising food demand for all commodities and the implied levels of kcal/person/day. We noted in Chapter2(Table2.2)that68percentofthepopulationof the developing countries will be in countries with over 3000 kcal/person/day in 2050. Inevitably, consumption of these calorie-rich foods (oils and products) cannot continue growing at the fast rates of the past. This prospect notwithstanding, there will still be many low income countries which in 2050 will have per capita consumption of fats and oils totally inadequate for good nutrition, the result of persistent low incomes andpoverty. Non-food industrial uses. We noted earlier the inadequacy of the statistics on oilcrop products used for non-foodindustrialpurposes.Wealsonotedthatsomeof theindustrialproductsresultingfromsuchusehavehigh incomeelasticitiesofdemand.Inaddition,vegetableoils may be increasingly used as feedstocks for production of biofuels. Palmoil from the main producing countries (MalaysiaandIndonesia)couldbeforthebiodieselsector what sugar cane is proving to be for bioethanol12. The latest projections of the European Commission foresee that some 10 million tonnes of oilseeds (20 percent of total consumption in the EU25 of both domestically producedandimportedoilseeds)maybeusedtoproduce bioenergy in 2012, up from 3.6 million tonnes in 2003. Inaddition,some1.5milliontonnesofgrainsmaybeso used (European Commission, 2005b: Tables A.1, A.8). Thereis,therefore,aprima faciecasetobelievethatthe shareoftotalvegetableoilproductiongoingtonon-food

industrialuseswillcontinuetogrowfairlyrapidly.Inthe projections, we make an allowance for this category of demand to grow at rates above those of the demand for food (3.2 percent p.a. versus 1.5 percent p.a. over the entireprojectionperiodto2050).By2050suchusesmay account for some 42 percent of total use compared with 24percentatpresentandonly16percent30yearsago. Trade.Theprojectedfairlybuoyantgrowthindemand, and the still considerable potential for expansion of production in some of the major exporters (see below), suggest that past trade patterns will continue for some time-thatis,rapidlygrowingimportsinmostdeveloping countries, matched by continued export growth of the mainexporters.TheprojectionsareshowninTable3.11. Thepotentialforfurtherproductionandexportincreases of several developing countries, and the continued growth of demand (mainly for non-food uses, including oilmeals for feed) in the industrial countries together withthelimitationintheirpotentialtoexpandproduction (particularly under policy reforms limiting the use of subsidies) would likely lead to the net export surplus of the developing countries rising again13, with Brazil playinganevergrowingroleinsuchdevelopments. Production. The production analysis of the oilcrops sector is conducted separately in terms of the individual cropslistedinTable3.12.Cottonisincludedamongthese crops because it contributes some 4 percent of world oil production,thoughprojectedproductionisdeterminedin the context of world demand-supply balance of cotton fibre rather than oil. The production projections for these major oilcrops are shown in Table 3.12. We noted earlierthatoilcropproductionhasbeenresponsiblefora good part of the area expansion under crops in, mainly, the developing countries. The relatively land-intensive nature of oilcrop production growth reflects in large part the fact that they are predominantly rainfed crops (less than ten percent irrigated, compared with about 40percentforcereals). Intheperiodto2050oilcropproductionisrequiredto continuegrowingalbeitatratessignificantlybelowthose of the past (Table 3.12). Even at those lower rates, the absolute increments involved are very large for some of thesecrops,e.g.morethantriplingforsoybeansandthe

oil palm. Given their land-intensive nature, the question whetherthereisenoughlandforsuchexpansionwithout seriously threatening forest areas must be posed14. We illustrate what is involved on the basis of the example ofsoybeans.Thethreemainsoybeanexportingcountries (the USA, Brazil andArgentina) account for 80 percent of world output, with the two SouthAmerican countries having increased their share from 20 percent twenty years ago to 34 percent in 1999/01, while the share of the USA correspondingly declined from 64 percent to 45percent15.Thesoybeansharvestedareainthesethree countries is currently 52 million ha16 (having increased 37percentinthelasttwodecades)andtheaverageyield is 2.53 t/ha, having grown 33 percent over the same period.Assuming they maintain their share in the world total, a tripling of their production - it had quadrupled in the preceding 30 years - would be required by 2050, with South America, particularly Brazil, accounting for an ever growing share17. A near doubling of the area under cultivation would be probably required, even assuming future yields matched the highest yield encountered currently in rainfed cultivation under high input technology in the USA. How much land suitable for growing soybeans under high input technology18 do thesecountrieshave? AccordingtotheFAO/IIASAGlobal Agroecological Zones Study (GAEZ, Fischer et al., 2002) Brazil has some21millionhaoflandsuitableforsoybeans(classes Very SuitableandSuitable-notincludinglandinclosed forestandinprotectedareas)orsome66millionhaifwe includealsotheMedium Suitableclass.Itusescurrently (2005) 23 million ha, up from only 14 million ha only 5 years earlier.

Naturally, not all

The expansion rates of the past cannot be continued and even at the lower rates of increase projected here expansion of soybeans area will be pressing against landresources.

3.5 Roots, tubers and plantains
Food consumption of roots, tubers and plantains. Average world food consumption is 69 kg per capita, providing 6 percent of total food calories. As noted in Chapter2,theseproductsrepresentthemainstayofdiets inseveralcountries,manyofwhicharecharacterizedby lowoverallfoodconsumptionlevelsandfoodinsecurity. Thegreatmajorityofthesecountriesareinsub-Saharan Africa. The region's per capita consumption is some 190 kg which provide 23 percent of total calories, but somecountriesdependoverwhelminglyontheseproducts forfood(seeChapter2). The high dependence on roots, tubers and plantains reflectstheagroecologicalconditionsof thesecountries, which make these products suitable subsistence crops, and to a large extent also the persistence of poverty and lack of progress towards diet diversification. There are significantdifferencesastowhichofthesestarchyfoods providethemainstayofdietsinthe19countriesdependent on this family of products.

14 It is said that the expansion of soybean production in Brazil is contributing to deforestation in the Amazon, not so much because forest land is converted for soybean cultivation but rather because it drives expansion into the forest for grazing and rice cultivation ("Exports blamed for Amazon deforestation", Financial Times, 14-01-05). Environmental groups also claim that expansion of the oilpalm is destroying rainforest and threatens the habitat of apes (BBC, "Shoppers `threat to orang-utans'" 23-09-05; also "Worse than Fossil Fuel" Guardian, 6th December 2005). 15 Provisional production data for 2005 suggest that the share of Argentina and Brazil increased further to 42 percent and that of the USA declined to 39 percent. 16 Provisional 2005 data: 66 million ha. 17 FAPRI, 2005, projects that Brazil will have overtaken the USA as the World's largest producer of soybeans by 2010. 18WeusetheestimatesoflandsuitableforsoybeansasevaluatedbytheGAEZforthe"high input rainfed" variant, given that the yields these countries  achievecurrentlyareclosetoorabovethe2.5-2.8tonnes/hageneratedbytheGAEZforthisvariantforlandclassesVS-Sontheaverage.

majority of which have very low levels of per capita consumption19. This contrasts with the position of the other starchy foods (particularly sweet potatoes but also cassava), whose per capita food consumption in the developing countries has apparently stagnated or declined20. However, caution is required in drawing firm inferences from these numbers because of the particularlypoorqualityofdataasregardstheproduction andconsumptionofseveralofthesecrops. Efforts to improve the cassava data in Africa in the context of COSCA21 suggest that cassava is far from being the inferior good put forward in traditional thinking. "The COSCA study found that the income elasticitiesofdemandforcassavaproductswerepositive at all income levels" (Nweke et al., 2002). Indeed, cassava played an important role in the nutrition gains madebyanumberofcountrieswhichfacedseverefood insecurityproblems.Forexample,gainsinpercapitafood consumptioninGhana(from1700caloriesin1979/81to 2580 calories in 1999/01) and in Nigeria (from 2050 to 2720)camelargelyfromincreasesintheproductionand consumptionofcassavaandsweetpotatoes­65percent and45percentofthetotalcalorieincreases,respectively. Indeed,thesetwocountriesarepresentedinFAO's2000 State of Food Insecurity in the World (FAO, 2000) as success cases in improving food security based on the diffusion of improved high-yielding cassava cultivars, largelydevelopedbyIITA(seealsoNweke,2004;Nweke et al.,2002). However, such gains were the exception rather than the rule in the many countries with food insecurity problems and high dependence on starchy foods. Only afewofthem(Ghana,Nigeria,Malawi,Benin,Rwanda, Angola,GuineaandPeru)registeredsignificantincreases inthepercapitafoodconsumptionoftheseproducts.The othershadnogains,indeedsomeofthemsufferedoutright declines according to the reported production statistics. Inconclusion,theexperiencesofthe"success"countries indicate that these crops have a promising potential to contribute to improved food security. Analyzing why

Feed uses of root crops. Significantquantitiesofroots are used as feed, mostly potatoes (14 percent of world production goes to feed), sweet potatoes (36 percent) and cassava(27percent).Asmallnumberofcountriesorcountry groups account for the bulk of such use. For potatoes, it is mostlythecountriesoftheformerSovietUnionandEastern Europe, and China. Potato feed use has declined in recent years in absolute tonnage as well as percentage terms, mainly as a result of the decline of the livestock sector in thetransitioncountries.Forsweetpotatoes,Chinaaccounts for almost the totality of world feed use and for about two thirds of world production. Feed use in China expanded rapidly up to the late 1990s following the fast growth of its livestock sector and the shift of human consumption to potatoesandotherpreferredfoods. For cassava, a few countries account for the bulk world feed use (Brazil, China, Nigeria, the EU15, Paraguay, Vietnam, Uganda, Ghana andAngola). Up to afewyearsagotheEU15wasbyfarthelargestuser.Its feed use of imported cassava peaked at some 25 million tonnes (fresh cassava equivalent) in 1990 and has fallen precipitously since then to the current some 5 million tonnes.

19 "Whereas potatoes are typically considered a cheap, starchy staple in industrialized countries, they tend to be high-priced and sometimes are luxury vegetables in the developing world..... Consumption of potato increases as income increases. The relationships for cassava and sweet potato are different. As per capita incomes increase, per capita consumption declines" (Scott et al., 2000). 20"OutsideofKerala(India)andisolatedmountainareasofVietNamandChina,mostcassavainAsiafordirectfoodpurposesisfirstprocessed.As   incomesincreaseovertime,alsotheseareaswillreducetheirnon-processedcassavaintakeinfavourofthepreferredrice.On-farmcassavaflour consumption, seems to behave in a similar way to non-processed cassava in Asia, as it is also substituted for rice as economic conditions improve.

countriesthathaveahighdependenceonthemandlow food consumption levels overall.The possible evolution in food consumption per capita is shown in Tables 2.7 and 2.8. The main factor that made for the decline in the average of the developing countries (precipitous decline of sweet potato food consumption in China) will be much weaker, as the scope for further declines is much more limited than in the past. In parallel, the two factors that make for increases in the average - the positive income elasticities of the demand for potatoes andthepotentialofferedbyproductivityincreasesinthe other roots (cassava, yams) - will continue to operate. It willbepossibleformorecountriesinsub-SaharanAfrica to replicate the experiences of countries like Nigeria, GhanaandMalawi,andincreasetheirfoodconsumption. Thus,therecentupturninpercapitaconsumptionofthe developingcountriesisprojectedtocontinue(Table2.7), whilethedecliningtrendinsub-SaharanAfrica(excluding NigeriaandGhana,Table2.8)maybereversed. Industrial non-food uses of cassava can benefit from theprospectthatthecropcanbecomeamajorfeedstock (along with sugar cane and maize) for the production of ethanol (see section on sugar below). Thailand is

3.6 Sugar
Consumption has been growing fast in the developing countries, which now account for 72 percent of world consumption (up from 49 percent 30 years ago), including the sugar equivalent of sugar crops used in non-food industrial uses (mainly Brazil's sugar cane used in ethanol production - see below). In contrast, food consumption has grown very little in the industrial countries, and has declined in the transition countries in the1990s.Animportantfactorinthestagnationofsugar consumption in the industrial countries has been the rapid expansion of corn-based sweeteners in the USA, where they now exceed consumption of sugar23.

is produced under heavy protection in the industrial countries,withtheexceptionofthetraditionalexporters amongthem(AustraliaandSouthAfrica­OECD,2002). Under this shelter, their production grew at 1.4 percent p.a. in the last three decades, at a time when their total consumption was not growing. The result has been that these countries turned from net importers of 8.9 million tonnes 30 years ago to net exporters of 4.4 million tonnes in 1999/01 (Figure 3.11). This reflected partly the growing exports of Australia, declining imports of the USA and to a smaller extent Japan, but above all it reflected the shifting of the EU from a net importer of 2.4 million tonnes to a net exporter of 4.2 million tonnes. The net exports of the developing exporters did not decline because over the same period the decline of theirexportstotheindustrialcountrieswascompensated by rising imports into the transition countries and the importing developing countries. The latter, particularly severalcountriesintheNearEast/NorthAfricaregionbut alsocountrieslikeIndonesiaandNigeria,playedamajor roleintheexpansionofworldtradeastheirimportsshot upinthesecondhalfofthenineties. A major characteristic of these developments is that the low prices prevailing in world markets acted as a disincentive to production in countries which failed to

improveproductivityand,togetherwiththerapidgrowth oftheirownconsumption,contributedtoturningseveral traditional exporting developing countries into net importers. These include countries like the Philippines, Peru, Mozambique and Taiwan (province of China). Collectively, they were net exporters of 2.3 million tonnesintheearly-seventies.Theynowhavenetimports of0.8milliontonnes. Concerning the future, food consumption of sugar in the developing countries is projected to continue to grow (Tables 2.7, 3.13). Growth could be higher than indicatedintheTablesifChina'spolicytolimitsaccharin consumptionsucceeded(Baron,2001,p.4).Muchofthe growth would occur in Asia, as Latin America and the NearEast/NorthAfricahavealreadyattainedfairlyhigh levelsofconsumption(Table2.8).Percapitaconsumption willprobablyremainconstantintheindustrialcountries, compared with declines in part of the historical period duringwhichcornsweetenersweresubstitutingforsugar intheUSA.Thisprocess,verypronounceduptothemideighties, has by now run its course. It could be reversed ifsugarpriceswerenottobesupportedatthehighlevels set by policy and/or maize prices were to rise following itsgrowinguseforethanolproduction(USDA,2006:21). Some increases are expected in the transition countries,

making up for some of the declines suffered during the 1990s. Given the lower population growth in the future, these developments suggest a further deceleration in the aggregate world food demand for sugar. As explained below, the impact on the world sugar sector may be compensated by the growing use of sugar crops for biofuelproduction. Animportantinfluenceonthesectormaybeexerted by the wider use of biofuels. As noted, the rise in the priceofpetroleumhaspromptedgreatlyrenewedinterest inbiofuelsassubstitutesforgasolineanddieselinmotor vehicles. Brazil, using sugar cane as the feedstock for producingethanol,leadstheway24:thecountry'salcohol production increased from 11.3 billion litres (lt.) in the 2001/02 crop year to 15 billion lt. in 2004/05 taking one half of the country's sugar cane production. Given Brazil's large cane production potential, this has not dentedsignificantlyitscapacitytoproducesugartomeet the growing demand for exports: over the same period Brazil's sugar production increased from 17 million tonnes(milliontonnes)to28milliontonnesandexports from 8 million tonnes to 18 million tonnes25. Other countrieshaveplanstoproduceethanolfromsugarcane26. Morecountrieswithabundantlandresourcessuitablefor producing low-cost biofuel crops (e.g. vegetable oils, cassava,inadditiontosugarcane)canbeexpectedtojoin thelistifdevelopmentsintheenergymarketssodictate. Notwithstanding the very weak data availability in this field,someprovisionmustbemadeintheprojectionsfor the prospect that the future of the sugar sector may be influencedsignificantlybythebiofuelfactor. FAO's data on non-food industrial uses of sugar can be utilised as a rough guide, though it is not known to what extent such use reflects fuel alcohol production. BrazilaccountsforthebulkoftheFAOdataonindustrial uses (70-80 percent of the world total). The FAO data on Brazil track fairly closely the data from independent sources of the country's alcohol production27 (Figure 3.12).Therefore, the existing FAO data (indicating such use of sugar of 16 million tonnes in 1999/01 ­ some

10 percent of world total sugar use) can be taken as a starting point for looking into the future. The OECD/ FAOsugarprojectionsforBrazilto2014(OECD,2005b) indicate a doubling of alcohol production from 2002-14 to some 26 billion lt. taking into account preliminary data showing a 20 percent recorded rise to 15 billion lt. from 2002-04 (of which some 2.4 billion lt. exported). Conservatively we project further growth at 3.5 percent p.a. (roughly that of Brazil's GDP). For the rest of the world we project analogous increases for the above mentioned countries with plans to produce alcohol from sugarcane.Theresultisthatthetrendtowardsdeclinein world use of sugar for industrial purposes in the 1990s (-0.8 percent p.a.) is reversed in these conservative assumptions and is projected to grow at 4.0 percent p.a. (Table 3.13). As noted, this upturn would contribute to keepingthegrowthrateofworldaggregatedemand(for alluses)andproductionfromdecliningasthegrowthof theworldfooddemandforsugardecelerates. Another factor that may make for deviations of the future in relation to the past in the sugar sector is the growing pressure on the industrial countries to reduce sugarprotectionism.Suchpressuresmaybearsomefruit in the not too distant future and lead to some shrinkage of sugar production in the industrial countries to the benefit of higher exports from the developing countries. The EU has been promoting reforms in this direction. If adopted and implemented they would have the result that the region would turn again into a net importer. The latest assessment by the EU Commission (2005a ­ Table 4) indicates that with the proposed reforms the EU-25 could turn into a net importer to the tune of 3.5milliontonnesin2012/13.Thiscompareswiththenet exportsof1.6milliontonnesin2004andthehigherlevels ofearlieryears.Suchdevelopment,eventuallyreinforced by more liberal trade policies of other major industrial importers, would lead to the industrial countries as a whole reverting to their "natural" status of being again net importers of sugar, a trend already foreshadowed by thevirtualdisappearanceoftheirnetsurplusin2004.

Naturally, the dollar exchange rate plays a decisive role here and competitiveness would be reduced if the dollar were to fall vis-à-vis the currency of the biofuel-producing countries.

The real boost to world trade will likely continue to come from the growing import requirements of the importing developing countries, both the major importers (see list in Table 3.13) and others that will be becomingsuch.Thetransitioncountrieswillcontinueto increase their imports though not as fast as in the past, inparticularbecauseRussia,theworld'slargestimporter (net imports 5.4 million tonnes in 1999/01, 73 percent of consumption), will likely move towards higher selfsufficiency(Gudosnikov,2001),givenalsosomedecline in aggregate consumption reflecting its already high per capitaconsumptionandfallingprojectedpopulation.

3.7 Concluding remarks
The future may see some drastic decline in the growth of world agriculture. The slowdown reflects the lower population growth and the gradual attainment of medium-high levels of per capita consumption in a growing number of countries. The latter factor restricts the scope for further growth in demand per capita in severalcountrieswhichfuelledmuchofthegrowthinthe historicalperiod,foremostamongthemChina.Incontrast, developingcountriesthatexperiencedslowgrowthinthe past(andasresultstillhavelowpercapitaconsumption -lessthan2700kcal/person/dayandpotentialforfurther growth) should not experience any slowdown but rather someacceleration. Increasingly, world agriculture may have to depend on non-food uses of its produce if growth rates are not to be sharply lower compared with the past. The biofuels sector may provide some scope, perhaps a significant one, for relaxing the constraints represented by the declining growth rates of the demand for human consumption. For the moment, biofuels from different crops in the different countries28 are not generally competitive without subsidies even at the US$ 60/barrel prices of oil, with the exception of ethanol from sugar cane in Brazil. This is true also for other countries producingsugarcane(orhavethepotentialtodoso),as

many of them do not have the appropriate combination oflandresourcesandproductivity,agriculturalpractices, infrastructure and technological prowess of Brazil. Still, these conditions are not immutable and "this experience with ethanol in Brazil could be replicated in other developing countries" (UNCTAD, 2005: 17). Africa, with its significant sugar cane production potential, is often cited as a region that could profit from Brazil's experience and technology29, though obstacles to realizing it (infrastructure, institutional, etc) should not be underestimated. Eventually, the competitiveness of biofuelsmaybefurtherenhanced(thoughnotbymuch­ KojimaandJohnson,2005)ifthesavingsofgreenhouse gas emissions resulting from substituting biofuels for petroleum-based fuels were to be monetized in the form oftradablecarboncredits(CertifiedEmissionReductions of greenhouse gases) through the Clean Development MechanismundertheprovisionsoftheKyotoProtocol. Notwithstandingtheuncertaintiesaboutthefutureof biofuels, the issue of alternative energy sources is very alive and questions are increasingly asked about the potential of world agriculture to become a significant sourceofbiomassfeedstocks(KojimaandJohnson,2005; Smeets et al.,2004).Althoughatpresentthepromotion of biofuels in several industrialized countries serves the additional(perhapstheprincipal)objectiveofsupporting theiragricultures(hencerestrictionsinimportsofbiofuels areusuallyanintegralpartofsuchpolicies),inthefuture it can have significant effects on world agriculture as it can offer novel development opportunities for countries withamplelandresources,e.g.severalcountriesinsubSaharan Africa, Latin America and South-East Asia, if barrierstotradeofbiofuelswereeased. At the same time as offering novel development opportunities,theissueofpossiblecompetitionbetween uses of agricultural resources for energy vs. food will be becoming increasingly relevant.Traditional food and fibreuseoflandmayloseoutinthiscompetitionsimply because, on the margin, the potential market for energy ishugeinrelationtothatforfood,eventuallyleadingto risingfoodprices.Thelattermaynotdentthewelfareof

28 Other crops currently used as feedstocks for ethanol production include sugar beets and cereals (mainly in Europe ­ the latest EU projections make an allowance for 1.5 million tonnes of cereals to be used for bioenergy production in 2012 - European Commission, 2005b) and maize (mainly in the USA, where strong growth is foreseen for the next 10 years when maize use for ethanol may reach 23 percent of production, i.e. more that twice present levels and surpassing exports as a major outlet for the crop­ USDA, 2006), while cassava is a promising candidate in countries like Thailand. Vegetable oils (mainly soybean oil in the USA and rapeseed oil in Europe) are also used in the production of biodiesel, while palm oil is considered to have a competitive edge over other oils. Among these crops, sugar cane has the advantage that its main by-product (bagasse) is used in the production of electricity thus making the ethanol  distilleriesvirtuallyself-sufficientinenergy. 29 Feature story on the World Bank President's visit to Brazil, 20 December 2005 (http://web.worldbank.org/wbsite/external/news/ 0,,contentMDK:20764365~menuPK:34457~pagePK:34370~piPK:34424~theSitePK:4607,00.html)
